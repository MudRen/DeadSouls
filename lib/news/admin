ADMIN: 

* To change your mud's name, use the command: mudconfig.
  For example: mudconfig mudname My Cool New Mud

* To make someone else an assistant admin also use admintool.
  Select groups, and modify the assist group.

* DO NOT try to modify mudos.cfg or groups.cfg unless you know
  what you're doing. IF you do try, be sure to back up the originals.

* To know what players can do, type:

read handbook

* To know what creators can do, type:

read manual

* And you really, really have to read chapters 31 through 38 of the
  manual. They are not long chapters, and you will be very happy
  you did.

* You now have an intermud channel available by default. If you
  see something like:

Cratylus@Dead Souls %^CYAN%^<dchat>%^RESET%^ Hi there!

  Don't be surprised. "dchat" is an intermud communication channel
  between Dead Souls muds. To chat, type: 

dchat blah blah

  It's new, so don't expect an answer right away.
