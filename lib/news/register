        Because some people from your site have caused us
        some trouble in the past, your site must register new
        characters with our law department before they are created.
        To register your character, mail:
				EMAIL

	Remember to include what character name you wish to use.
	Do NOT include a password!  You will create the character yourself.
	After you've sent the message, wait a little bit.
        Then try logging in a little later.
