// Configuration of available deputies
// from the Dead Souls Mudlib
// by Aleas

// here you define the deputies bought by the council
// 2x level of attacker ( closest match ) are sent for help
// if you add new deputies bought by the council,
// no need to retain ascending order, e.g.
//          DEPUTIES_LOW ({ 20, 10, 30, 5 })
// 
// LOW is an array of deputies against level 1-20 attackers
// HIGH is an array of deputies against level 21+ attackers

#define DEPUTIES_LOW ({ 25 })
#define DEPUTIES_HIGH ({ 50, })
