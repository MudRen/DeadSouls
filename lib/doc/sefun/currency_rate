CURRENCY_RATE(1)                                 CURRENCY_RATE(1)

NAME
       currency_rate() - returns how much of a currency equals
       one EU

SYNOPSIS
       float currency_rate(string type)

DESCRIPTION
       Given a currency type as an argument, this function will
       tell you how much of that currency is needed to equal one
       EU, or economic unit.  An economic unit is a base value
       used by the mud to set relative values.  The set_value()
       function in objects uses EU's.

EXAMPLES
       currency_rate("gold") would return 1.5 if, for example, it
       takes 3 gold to buy something that has a set_value() of 2.
