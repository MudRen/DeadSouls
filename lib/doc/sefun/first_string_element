FIRST_STRING_ELEMENT(1)               FIRST_STRING_ELEMENT(1)

NAME
       first_string_element() - Extracts the contents of a string before a delimiter.

SYNOPSIS
       string first_string_element(string path, string delimiter, int stripfirst)

DESCRIPTION
       Pretty much just tries to figure out what the top-level subdirectory
is of a file. It can be used with delimiters other than "/" if need be. If
used with a full pathname, the "stripfirst" flag should be set. If you don't
set the stripfirst flag and your string's first character is a delimiter, it
will return a null string.

EXAMPLES
       first_string_element("/realms/cratylus/workroom.c","/",1) 

returns "realms".
