NAME
       generate_tmp() - Create a unique temp filename.

SYNOPSIS
       varargs string generate_tmp(mixed arg)

DESCRIPTION
       If the user has a home directory, the function tries 
to use their tmp/ dir, otherwise /open is used. The filename is
generated by using the arguments, if any, and adding them to
ctime plus some random characters for good measure.

EXAMPLES
       generate_tmp(this_player()) returns "/realms/cratylus/tmp/cratylus80irhLDFd7sWg1140052843.c"
