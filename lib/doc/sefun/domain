DOMAIN(1)                                               DOMAIN(1)

NAME
       domain() - returns the domain to which an object belongs

SYNOPSIS
       string domain(object|string val)

DESCRIPTION
       Given an object as an argument, domain() will return the
       domain to which the object belongs based on its file name.
       If a string is passed, the string is assumed to be the
       file name of an object and the function will return the
       domain associated with that file name.

       Domains are determined based on the following criteria:

       o the return from query_domain() in the object if that
           value is a valid domain and the first argument is an
           object or a loadable file

       o the domain from which the object comes if its file name
           is from the mudlib domains directory

       o if the object is from a creator home directory, it
           checks the sub-directory of that home directory from
           which it came and returns it if it is a valid domain
           =back

EXAMPLES
       o   domain(ob) will return "NorthForest" if the file name
           is "/domains/NorthForest/sword" and ob->query_domain()
           returns 0

       o   domain("/realms/descartes/Orlith/entrance") returns
           "Orlith"
