BASE_NAME(1)                                         BASE_NAME(1)

NAME
       base_name() - returns the name of the object's original
       file

SYNOPSIS
       string base_name(mixed val)

DESCRIPTION
       If you pass an object name (returned by the file_name()
       efun) or an object itself, this function will return the
       name of the original file from which the object was loaded
       or cloned.  For master copies, the base_name() will equal
       the file_name().  For clones, the file_name() will be the
       base_name() plus an extension.

EXAMPLES
       base_name(find_living("orc")) might return "/std/monster"
