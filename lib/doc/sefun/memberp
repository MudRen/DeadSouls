MEMBERP(1)                               MEMBERP(1)

NAME
       memberp() - Determines whether a thing is a member of an array.

SYNOPSIS
       int memberp(mixed *primary, mixed sub)

DESCRIPTION
       If sub is a member of primary, returns 1. Otherwise, returns 0. It
is basically a prettification of member_array, which is the preferred way
of doing it. This sefun is much more expensive to use than the member_array
efun, but it's easier to read.

EXAMPLES
       memberp(({"foo","bar","baz"}), "baz")  would return 1
       memberp(({"foo","bar","baz"}), "shiz")  would return 0
