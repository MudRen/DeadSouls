REMOVE_MATCHING_LINE(1)         REMOVE_MATCHING_LINE(1)

NAME
       remove_matching_line() - Focused string removal.

SYNOPSIS
       varargs mixed remove_matching_line(string target, string substring, int i, string exclude)

DESCRIPTION
       Like replace_matching_line, rather than keying on 
newlines to determine where a line ends, this attempts 
to parse the code to identify the entire LPC instruction.
       Unlike replace_matching_line, this function only
deletes, it doesn't replace.
     
target:	This can be a string or a filename. If it is a filename, the
	file will be read and treated as a string.

substring: The string used to determine a match.

i:	Whether it should remove one matching line or all matching lines.

exclude: If the line matches but it also contains this string, do not remove.


EXAMPLES
       remove_matching_line("/realms/cratylus/workroom.c", "AddMeep",
       "Balky");

       This line would read my workroom into a string, and if it has a line 
that contains "AddMeep" that *doesn't* contain "Balky", it will remove that line
from the string.

NOTE: This will not change my workroom. It will return a string that I
can overwrite my workroom with, or that I can write to some other file.
