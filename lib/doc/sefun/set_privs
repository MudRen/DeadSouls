NAME
       set_privs() - prevents anyone from using the set_privs()
       efun

SYNOPSIS
       void set_privs(object ob, string str)

DESCRIPTION
       The Nightmare Mudlib security system does not allow for
       setting of privs after object creation, so the MudOS efun
       set_privs() needs to be overriidden to prevent this from
       happening.
