ABSOLUTE_PATH(1)                                 ABSOLUTE_PATH(1)

NAME
       absolute_path() - returns the full path starting at root

SYNOPSIS
       string absolute_path(string curr, string new)

DESCRIPTION
       Given any relative path, this function returns the full
       path from /.  The first argument is the base directory,
       and the second is the relative path you wish to make
       absolute.  If the second argument cannot be made absolute
       on its own, it is made absolute relative to the base
       directory, which is usually the current working directory.
       It understands special things like:

       o   ~/ represents the home directory of the command giver

       o   ~user represents the home directory of the user named

       o   ^domains represents the home directory of the domain
           named

       o

            . represents the current working directory

       o

            .. represents the parent of the current working directory

EXAMPLES
       o   absolute_path("/realms/descartes", "monster.c")
           returns "/realms/descartes/monster.c"

       o   absolute_path("/std", "~workroom.c") returns
           "/realms/descartes/workroom.c"
