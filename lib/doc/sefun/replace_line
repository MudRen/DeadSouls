REPLACE_LINE(1)                               REPLACE_LINE(1)

NAME
       replace_line() - Reads a string and replaces a line with substitute text.

SYNOPSIS
       string replace_line(string file, string *params, string repl)

DESCRIPTION
       Provided a string, search parameter(s), and replacement text, this
function finds every matching line and replaces it with the supplied substitution.

EXAMPLES
       replace_line(read_file("/realms/cratylus/workroom.c",({"Add","Monkey"}),
              "SetFoo(\"Donkey\");")

If my workroom contains the line:

AddFoo("Monkey");

Then this function will return the full text of my workroom file, but
with the above string replaced by the one below:

SetFoo("Donkey");

The line must match *all* of the parameters, or the replacement does not
occur. For example, the line:

SetMoo("Monkey");

would be left unchanged, because it doesn't contain "Add".

NOTE: This does not modify files. To do so, you'll need to use the output
of this funtion as the second argument in the write_file efun.
