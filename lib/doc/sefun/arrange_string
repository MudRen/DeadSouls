ARRANGE_STRING(1)                               ARRANGE_STRING(1)

NAME
       arrange_string() - arranges a string to a given length

SYNOPSIS
       string arrange_string(string str, int x)

DESCRIPTION
       Passed a string and a length, this function returns the
       original string either cut to or extended to the length
       specified by the second argument.  If the length of the
       original string is longer than the length specified, then
       all characters beyond the length specified are cut off.
       If the length is less than the original string's length,
       then the original string is padded with spaces so that it
       ends up being as long as the length specified.

EXAMPLES
       o   arrange_string("resistence is futile", 25) returns
           "resistence is futile     "

       o   arrange_string("gurble", 2) returns "gu"

NOTES
       Do not use this function inside the mudlib, as it is slow.
       Instead use sprintf().  This sefun exists to make life
       easy on creators.
