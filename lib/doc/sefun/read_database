READ_DATABASE(1)                                 READ_DATABASE(1)

NAME
       read_database() - returns an array of non-commented file
       lines

SYNOPSIS
       string *read_database(string file)

DESCRIPTION
       Given a file to read, this function will read the file and
       return an array of lines without any comments or blank
       lines.  Commented lines start with a # sign.

NOTES
       This function is an immensely inefficient way to handle
       this.  I must have been on drugs when I wrote it.
