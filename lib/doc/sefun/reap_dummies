NAME
       reap_dummies() - Destructs dummy objects without an environment.

SYNOPSIS
       void reap_dummies()

DESCRIPTION
       Early versions of Dead Souls were prone to memory leaks in the
form of dummy items failing to be destructed. The sefun is part of
the effort to address the symptoms of that issue.
