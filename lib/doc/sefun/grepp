GREPP(1)                               GREPP(1)

NAME
       grepp() - Whether a given substring is in a string.

SYNOPSIS
      grepp(string primary, string sub)

DESCRIPTION
       If sub is a member of primary, returns 1. Otherwise, returns 0. It
is basically a prettification of strsrch, which is the preferred way
of doing it. This sefun is much more expensive to use than the strsrch
efun, but it's easier to read.

EXAMPLES
       grepp("foo, barbaz", "baz")  would return 1
       grepp("foo, barbaz", "shiz")  would return 0

SEE ALSO
       strsrch
