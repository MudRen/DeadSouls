NAME
       exec() - provides security for the MudOS exec() efun

SYNOPSIS
       int exec(object target, object src)

DESCRIPTION
       Since MudOS appropriately provides no security for this
       efun, the mudlib must decide what security it wants in an
       efun override.

LOCATION
       /secure/sefun/sefun.c
