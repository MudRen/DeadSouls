SAY(1)                                                     SAY(1)

NAME
       say() - sends a message to objects in the same room as
       command giver

SYNOPSIS
       varargs void say(mixed str, object ob)

DESCRIPTION
       This function sends a message, the first argument, to all
       users in the same room as the command giver other than the
       command giver (this_player()).  The message is sent as
       message class "other_action".  If a second argument is
       given, that object is excluded from hearing the message.

NOTES
       This is an override of the MudOS efun by the same name.
       In order to be AMCP compliant, all messages need to go
       through receive_message().  This function allows creators
       to continuing using the oldstyle messaging while remaining
       compliant.
