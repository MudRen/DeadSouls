DESTRUCT(1)                                           DESTRUCT(1)

NAME
       destruct() - provides security for the destruct() efun

SYNOPSIS
       int destruct(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
       Since the MudOS efun destruct() appropriately has no
       security tied to it, and the Nightmare Mudlib wished
       destructions to be tied to security, the Nightmare Mudlib
       overrides the MudOS destruct() efun.  The destruct() efun
       removes the object passed from memory.
