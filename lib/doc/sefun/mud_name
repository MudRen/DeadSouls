MUD_NAME(1)                                           MUD_NAME(1)

NAME
       mud_name() - returns the name of the MUD

SYNOPSIS
       string mud_name()

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the official name of the MUD.  This information is
       taken from the driver config file.

NOTES
       If you are pretty stable with your MUD's name, then you
       really do not need to use this function.  It is used
       through the mudlib, since the mudlib may be used on many
       MUDs.  Using this once your MUD is relatively stable will
       server to slow things down when you do not need the
       flexibility.
