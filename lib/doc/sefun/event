NAME
       event() - sets up an event to occur regularly

SYNOPSIS
       varargs void event(string fun, int when, mixed *args, int
       reg)

DESCRIPTION
       This function is exactly like the call_out() efun, except
       in that this sefun works across reboots.  This is
       useful for setting up long terms events, such as monthly
       goblin raids or lunar based lycanthropy.  The first
       argument is a string representing the name of the function
       to be called.  The second argument is how long after
       event() is called that the first event should happen.  The
       third and fourth arguments are optional.  If given, the
       third argument is an array of arguments to be passed to
       the function when it is called.  In addition, the fourth
       argument, is a flag.  If given and 1, it flags the event
       to be recurring.  If not give or 0, the event will only
       happen the first time.

EXAMPLES
       o   event("call_war", MONTH) will set the function
           call_war() to be called one mud month from now
