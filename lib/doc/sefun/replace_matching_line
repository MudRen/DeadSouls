REPLACE_MATCHING_LINE(1)         REPLACE_MATCHING_LINE(1)

NAME
       replace_matching_line() - Focused string replacement.

SYNOPSIS
       varargs mixed replace_matching_line(string target, string substring, string replace, int i, string exclude)

DESCRIPTION
      This monstrosity is quite different from 
replace_line. Rather than keying on 
newlines to determine where a line ends, it attempts 
to parse the code to identify
the entire LPC instruction. 
     
target:	This can be a string or a filename. If it is a filename, the
	file will be read and treated as a string.

substring: The string used to determine a match.

replace: The replacement line.

i:	Whether it should replace one matching line or all matching lines.

exclude: If the line matches but it also contains this string, do not replace.


EXAMPLES
       replace_matching_line("/realms/cratylus/workroom.c", "AddMeep",
"SetMeep(([\"feep\":\"Meepos\",\n\"meep\":\"Feepos\",\n]));", "Balky");

       This line would read my workroom into a string, and if it has a line 
that contains "AddMeep" that *doesn't* contain "Balky", it will remove that line
from the string and replace it with my SetMeep substitute.

NOTE: This will not change my workroom. It will return a string that I
can overwrite my workroom with, or that I can write to some other file.
