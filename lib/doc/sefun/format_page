FORMAT_PAGE(1)                                     FORMAT_PAGE(1)

NAME
       format_page() - returns a string of formatted columns from
       an array

SYNOPSIS
       string format_page(string *items, int columns)

DESCRIPTION
       Given an array of strings and a number of columns as
       arguments, this function formats the array into a single
       string with the elements put into the number of columns
       specified.  Unfortunately, as this sefun predates
       Nightmare terminal support, this sefun only supports
       80 character screen widths.

EXAMPLES
       format_page(({ "house", "car", "cat", "mouse", "dog" }),
       3) returns "house                       car
       cat
        mouse                       dog"

NOTES
       This sefun is pretty much out of date and useless for
       new uses.
