I'd like to thank the following people for their help, witting or
otherwise, in making the new release of Dead Souls possible:

Sine qua non: Descartes, the legion of MudOS developers, and
              all those coders who toiled at Nightmare, and Lars Pensjö.
              Marius for his permission to bundle MudOS, and
              Wodan for his permission to bundle FluffOS and his
              ongoing support therein.

              and his willingness to let me poke through his lib and
	      filch code. Great thanks to Marajin for his direct and
	      substantial contribution to the Cygwin Windows port.
                  Much gratitude to Saquivor, for whom a town street is
              now named, for getting the Windows socket code working.
