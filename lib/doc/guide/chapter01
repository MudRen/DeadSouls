chapter 1 "Introduction"

    If you're reading this, you've probably been
successful in installing Dead Souls, and are able
to get around and manipulate stuff within it. 

    There are lots of questions that new admins
have at this point. This book is not intended to
answer them. Specific questions about administration
are handled in the Admin FAQ, which you can read
at http://dead-souls.net/ds-admin-faq.html . A
local copy is archived in the /www directory, but
this may be out of date by now, and you'd be best
served by looking at the online version.

    This guidebook isn't about "how to" or "where
is," although such issues may be handled incidentally.
The point of this guidebook is to describe to you
various principles that are important to your
success as a Dead Souls mud admin.

    The tone of these chapters is intended to be
conversational. Because of this, it may sound like
I'm being condescending (that means "talking down
to you"), but that isn't intentional. I'm
assuming that you fully understand I'm not the boss
of you, that you can decide for yourself what is
best for your mud, and that the contents of this
guidebook are thoroughly biased.

    However rambling these pages might be, know that
I claim no authority over What Should Be. I can only
tell you, from my experience, how things look, and
how I *think* things work best.
