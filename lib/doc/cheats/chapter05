chapter 5 "Princess Daphne"

This quest is both very easy and very hard. In any case it is very simple.

Princess Daphne is the name of a very valuable diamond which is on sale in the
Campus Bookstore...the same place you bought a lab coat for Kleiner. The way
to solve this quest is to scavenge and scrounge, making and finding coins, 
and then convering all that money into 50,000 dollars at the bank. Then you
go to the campus bookstore, buy the diamond, then go to Dirk at the
Adventurer's Hall and give him the diamond.

Easy in principle, but it will take some grinding and exploring to get it 
done. I suggest you go to Radagast and use the training ponts you earned
with all this leveling up and get trained up on your mage levels. Radagast
is a trainer and is one room up from Dirk in the Adventurer's Hall. Don't 
bother asking Herkimer to train you, he doesn't know how. Go to Radagast.

Protip: You train better if you're smarter. If you've found a magic 
pipe somewhere, guess what, the magic is that you're slightly smarter
if you smoke it. If you have it, find (or buy) some matches, then

strike match
light pipe with match
smoke pipe

Pipe or not, to train with Radagast:

ask radagast to train magic attack
ask radagast to train magic defense
ask radagast to train conjuring

If you don't speak English because you picked elf as your race, you
will need to go to Bugg (1d, 1n, 2e, 1n of Radagast) and "ask bugg to teach english" a
few times until you're fluent. It'll cost you a few training points, but that's better 
than not being able to train up on magic.
