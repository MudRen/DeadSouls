chapter 3 "Orcmaster quest"

This one is a bit easier. Again, we can get this done without actual combat.

So you're now a mage standing in the Mage's Guild. Let's head over to Roshd
Burlyneck, the Fighter guildmaster who is looking for his missing helmet. Remember 
the helmet you got off the dead orc shaman? Exactly. Two birds with one stone. 

1n, 1e, 1n, 4w, 26n, enter cave

Remember this place? We're goig to teleport to a different location now:

cast light
look
dial tower
enter gate

1d, 1s, 1w, 1n

You're now in the Fighter's Guild. 

give helmet to roshd

Now what on earth just happened? What's all this weird text?
That's a language you do not understand, Tangetto. It is the language of the Orcs.

Roshd just told you thanks dude, if you want to join the Fighter's guild, now you can.

Now you know how yo join the Fighter's 
guild if you want to. Since you're already a human mage that doesn't help you much now, 
but if you want to play through again later with a new character that's, say, an orc,
you now know how to get hooked up.

That's not to say that humans can't be fighters by the way. I'm just saying that 
*statistically* it may be more rewarding to choose a bulkier race for that. You 
do you, tho, breh.
