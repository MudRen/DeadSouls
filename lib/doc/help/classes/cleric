The cleric holds the natural world in highest esteem, shunning
violence and things unnatural.  They specialize in the healing arts
and defense against magic and blunt weapons.  They also have powers of
faith which draw from the gods of the natural world they worship.

A person who chooses to play a cleric will never fight powerfully.
Instead, people playing clerics
play the class because they enjoy working with teams to accomplish a
task and also because they love helping others.  Clerics are most
often seen as doctors or party healers in adventuring groups.

One exception to the cleric non-violence oath is their power over the
unnatural world of the undead.  Their faith bestows upon them the
ability to rid the world of the undead, or to bring the undead back to
the world of the living.
