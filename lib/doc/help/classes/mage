Mages are powerful magic users who make their livings through their
magical talents.  They are an integral piece to any adventuring group,
as many situations require the use of magic to change the way the die
have been cast.  Given so much attention to the magic arts, however,
mages find themselves poorly suited to weapon-based combat.  Thus,
when engaged in combat, mages tend to rely instead on their magic
talents to avoid damage and strike at their opponents.

The mage class is perhaps better suited to the hack-n-slash style of
player, through role-players and socials can likely find attractive
characteristics in a well played mage.
