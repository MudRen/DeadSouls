Explorers are well-rounded folk who are capable of learning
spells relatively well, yet can still handle themselves in 
a fierce fight. 

Since explorers do not specialize in any specific set of
skills, they lack the spellcasting might of mages, the
formidable melee power of fighters and the fancy shadowcraft
of thieves, but they also lack the weaknesses of those classes.

Explorers are jacks of all trades, masters of none.
