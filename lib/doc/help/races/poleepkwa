Poleepkwa are a large, bipedal race bearing a strong resemblance to insects. The most commonly encountered poleepkwa are soldier drones: extremely strong but unwise, unintelligent, and uncharismatic. They also tend to change little over time as they gain experience: their stats improve very slowly.

Due to the severe challenges of poleepkwa psychology and physiology, only very experienced players should choose this as a race.
