What are training points?
 
    Training Points are awarded for achieving a new level. They
    are not meant to be a means of advancing in the game, training
    points are to be considered an extra bonus.
 
How can I see my points?
 
    Your training points are listed under the "score" command.
 
How are points earned?
 
    As stated above, Training points are earned when you gain
    a new and "unique" level. A unique level is defined as a
    a level you have never before attained with your character.
 
How does death affect points?
 
    If you happen to lose a level (or levels) upon dying you
    will be penalized 4 points per level. This does not apply
    to newbies simply because they do not lose levels from
    dying.
 
    For example, player Bob raises to level 6 and earns four
    training points. Player Bob dies a horrible death and
    finds himself at level 5 once again. Because Bob lost
    a level he received -4 points. When our example reaches
    level 6 again, he will "technically" earn 4 points to
    compensate for the recently lost points. As you can see,
    a player can only truly earn points for each "unique"
    level gained.
 
How do I use my training points?
 
    Throughout Dead Souls there are a number of NPCs who specialize
    in training various skills. Trainers accept the following
    commands; "ask <NPC> to help" will list the skills that the
    NPC is capable of training. "ask <NPC> to train <SKILL>"
    will start the process of training in the named skill.
 
    Please note that creators (including arches) cannot answer
    questions regarding non-technical game play. To find a
    trainer, you must search for yourself or ask other players.
