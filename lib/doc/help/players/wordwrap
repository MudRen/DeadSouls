Different clients do different things. Dead Souls tries to handle
the most common setups automatically. This may not be enough for you.

Here are some common issues:

1) You set the screen to something (like 100 50) but it keeps changing
   to something else.

This is usually because your client is sending invisible resizing commands
to the mud, and the mud is honoring those commands. To stop this, you
lock your screen settings, and then set the screen parameters:
%^GREEN%^
screenlock on
screen 100 50
%^RESET%^

2) You set your width and/or height to a very large number but it's 
   smaller when you check it.

Your screen setting tries to limit itself to the size of the mud's
maximum printable string size...a number which is fairly arbitrary and
mostly there to avoid excessive spamming of players. This limit can
only be changed by an administrator willing to recompile the driver
with a changed value for the LARGEST_PRINTABLE_STRING opton.


3) You set your width to something very large but not all text goes that wide.

Some text, like this file, are written with hard returns somewhere before the
80th column. This is usually due to a preference the author has, and is
common among lib folks of a certain vintage. If you find instances where
this is particularly unattractive, talk it over with your admin to see
if they want to add it to their list of things to clean up.
