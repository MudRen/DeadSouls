As with most other non-player characters (NPCs), bank tellers respond
to certain requests players make using the "ask" and "request"
commands.  Dead Souls bank tellers respond to at least the following
requests:
 
request account from TELLER
request balance from TELLER
ask TELLER to deposit AMOUNT CURRENCY
ask TELLER to withdraw AMOUNT CURRENCY
ask TELLER to exchange AMOUNT CURRENCY for CURRENCY
 
examples:
 
ask teller to deposit 100 gold
ask teller to withdraw 10 platinum
ask teller to exchange 10 electrum for silver
 
notes:
 
- All banks require a minimum balance to open an account.
  To use any of the bank's services, you must first open an
  account with the bank (request account...).
 
- Banks may have more than one location.  You can bank at any
  location once you have opened an account with the named bank.
 
- Some banks charge for certain transactions.  The charges vary
  from bank to bank, but may be influenced by whether or not you
  are a local resident in the town the bank resides in.
