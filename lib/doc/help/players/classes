As a character on Dead Souls, your learned abilities, also known as
skills, are determined by your class.  Before you join a class, you
have no skills and are able to do virtually nothing. It is thus
essential that you join a class as soon as you have determined how you
wish to play Dead Souls.

How do you wish to play Dead Souls?
Dead Souls can be played towards many different ends, limited only by
your imagination.  Each class is designed to fit a different playing
philosophy and experience.  For example, some people prefer pure
"hack-n-slash" gaming.  Fighters are well suited to this type of
player.  Other players, however, prefer socialization and role-playing
over monster killing and adventuring.  Fishers are ideally suited
towards this end.
 
When you join a class, you will be provided with set of skills both in
which your class excels over others as well as which determine your
success within your class.  In addition, you gain an improved ability 
for learning, both through training and experience, those skills that are 
associated with your class. 

What you choose to do with these skills is  up to you. Membership in a
class only suggests that you have certain  talents that you tend to
specialize at or that you are simply just  naturally good at. Once you
join a class, you are a member for life,  and it becomes your primary
source of power. In the reality of Dead Souls, there are four basic
classes of people:  
  
    clerics, fighters, mages, thieves.  
 
There are help files on each of these.

Each class has four primary skills, as well as other skills which are
important to them.  The primary skills determine your level.  Level is
simply a way to measure how good you are at your class.  It does not
serve as a method for comparing players of different classes.  In
other words, the only thing you can say about a level 10 fighter and a
level 10 mage, is that the mage magicks as well as the fighter
fights.  It does not suggest that the fighter should be able to cast spells
as well as the mage, nor that the mage should be able to fight as
well as the fighter.
