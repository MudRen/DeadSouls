Syntax: alias <short version> <long version>
        alias <short version> <long version> $*

This command lets you substitute a short command for a long one.
For example, rather than type out "get all from corpse" you
can create this alias:

%^GREEN%^alias gc get all from corpse%^RESET%^

And all you need do is type "gc" to get the same effect.
You can also use a wildcard, like this:

%^GREEN%^alias gc get all from $* corpse%^RESET%^

So that typing: %^GREEN%^gc first%^RESET%^
Expands out to: %^GREEN%^get all from first corpse%^RESET%^

The wildcard is also helpful for channel aliases:

%^GREEN%^alias ige intergossipemote $*%^RESET%^

To see your aliases, type: %^GREEN%^alias%^RESET%^

To see a specific alias, like gc: %^GREEN%^alias gc%^RESET%^

To remove an alias, type unalias plus the alias, like so:

%^GREEN%^unalias gc%^RESET%^
