			 Dead Souls Languages

Languages are essential to the way interaction occurs among players
and non-player characters.  Every discussion you will have with an npc
will be done through that npc's native tongue generally (although some
npc's are more aware of other languages).  

When starting as a newbie, you will not much notice this.  Newbies are
given full knowledge of all languages.  This, however, does not last.
Once you cease to be a newbie, you only know your native language,
which you learn based on your race.  

As time goes on, you may wish to learn new languages.  Certain npc's
across Dead Souls specialize in teaching people other languages.  In
order to learn a new language, use the "ask" command to ask the npc to
teach you the language.  The syntax is <ask LIVING to teach me LANGUAGE>.
For example:

	%^GREEN%^ask the sage to teach me nymal%^RESET%^

Not all teachers may know all languages.  The teacher must naturally
know the language in order to teach it.

The teacher will generally start spouting phrases in the language,
asking you to repeat them.  It is to your advantage to try and repeat
what the teacher is saying in the language it is being said.

To know what languages you speak, type: language

To speak in a language other than your native one, type:

speak in LANGUAGE MESSAGE

example:

%^GREEN%^speak in edhellen hi i speak a little elvish%^RESET%^

To switch your default language to Valar (if you know it):

%^GREEN%^speak in valar%^RESET%^

This makes you use the Valar language whenever you "say" something.
