A creator (sometimes also called a wizard or wiz) is
a user on the mud that has access to special commands
that allow for the manipulation of game data.

A creator can, with some restrictions, edit files,
modify stats, create new rooms, objects, and NPC's. 
They, like admins, are mud staff and share the
responsibility of improving and enhancing it.

If you are a new creator, take the time to get familiar
with how the mud works. You have your very own workroom.
To go to it, type: home

There you can open your chest and get a standard set 
of creator tools (sometimes also called wiztoys) and
get a sense for how things work.

Remember that although you have fantastic, superhuman
powers, you must use them responsibly. You have, for
example, the zap command, which lets you kill almost
anything instantly. Having the command, however, is
not permission to run through the mud zapping every
mob you see. Talk to your admin about what is ok
and not ok. 

If you are new to this kind of mud, read the Player's
Handbook. If you dont have one on you, type:

clone /domains/default/obj/handbook
read chapter 1 in handbook
read chapter 2 in handbook

And so on. Once you've read the handbook, read over
the Creator FAQ at http://dead-souls.net/ds-creator-faq.html
and when you feel ready to start using your Creator
powers, start reading the Creator's Manual.

Contributing to a mud can be hard work, and if you've
never done it before, it'll be a steep learning curve.
However, remember that this mud has tons of documentation,
and this kind of mud is one of the easiest for newcomers.
Just relax, take your time, and don't get stressed.
