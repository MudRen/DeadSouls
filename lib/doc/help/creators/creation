                      Dead Souls Quick Creation System
 
One of the biggest obstacles to creating a large area is the tedious nature
of coding every last detail by hand, using the ed editor.

    This new creation system helps relieve the tedium by providing
a way to quickly create working stuff, which you can then conveniently modify
without having to continually muck about in ed.

    There are still things you need to do with ed, such as searches, complex
exits, and the like, but the bulk of your building will go much more 
quickly using the new system. 

    A thorough builder's manual on using the new system is in the works.

In the meantime, take a look below at the commands in actual use, with a
few added comments:
