Your profile is a file that contains a list of 
instructions. When you log in, the mud will force
you to execute those commands. To modify what those
"startup commands" are, edit the .profile file in
your home directory. For example:

cd
ed .profile

Note that the mud cannot force you to do 
certain things as a security measure.
