[ Addemote General Help ]
 
Note: All examples are from the 'emoter' perspective.
  Basic emote:  $N smile $A.
    - $N is the name of the emoter.  $N *must* be used in both
      (emote) and (environment) fields to preserve functionality.
      This means do not enter 'You smile $A.'.
 
    - $A field means the user can specify any adverb from the soul's
      pool of adverbs.  (This also applies to any specific adverbs
      (assigned to the emote). If the user does not specify an adverb,
      and no default adverb is set, this field is ignored.
 
  Targeted Emote: $N smile $A at $T
    - $T field displays the name of the target (player).  If no
      target is found, A 'no target' emote will be used in place
      of targeted.
 
  Locations: $N pokes $A $T $X
    - $X acts the same as $A, only it searches through a list
      of locations assigned to the emote in question.  If no
      location is specified by user, and a default setting exists,
      it will be used automatically.  Otherwise, $X is simply ignored.
      Note that all locations are prepended with an assigned
      preposition (if used).  (example: locations set to 'nose, head,
      ear', preposition set to 'on the'.
 
  Extra Field: $N scratch $*
    - If the $* field is used, all lefteover arguments will be
      put here.
