MSSP is a protocol that allows someone else's internet program to
connect to your mud and ask it for information. For example, your
mud's name, how many players are on, what your theme is, etc.

It's useful because it lets you maintain an up to date
source of information on your mud for multiple mud listing
sites, without having to schlep to each one to update your
listing to keep it current.

To change your MSSP info, edit /secure/include/mssp.h and
change the fields you feel need changing.

VITALLY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you modify information in that
file and create broken LPC code, you may render your mud
impossible to log into, and unbootable. Make 100% certain you
back up this file before editing it, and once you edit it,
make sure it works by updating LIB_CONNECT.

bk /secure/include/mssp.h
update /secure/lib/connect.c
