		The dead_souls intermud channel

	There is an internet communication protocol that
allows muds to send and receive information from each other. This
is called the Intermud network, of which there are several
versions and subnets.

	By default, your mud is connected to the Intermud3
network, or I3 (see intermud.org for specs). On this
network there are numerous channels available: some are
friendly, some are hostile, some are invitation-only, and
some are open to all.

	Unless your admins have disabled intermud, or you
are tightly firewalled, or channels have been restricted, 
you probably are listening to a channel called "dead_souls". 
This channel exists to allow creators on Dead Souls muds
on the internet to talk, ask questions, share ideas, etc.

	Random chat is not exactly discouraged, but code
questions and discussions always have priority on this
channel. It can be used socially, but its primary purpose
is as a support system for the Dead Souls community.
Accordingly, muds that spam the channel, or subject it
to malicious data or metadata, are likely to be permanently
banned from it, regardless of whether it was the fault of
just one jerk. Messages of an offensive nature also
qualify as bannable material, and this is at the discretion
of the owner of the channel, which is the Dead Souls mud.

	If you need to perform channel testing, please avoid
using the dead_souls channel ( also known as <ds> ) for
this. A special testing channel has been set up for that
purpose. It is called ds_test, and you can add it to
yourself by typing:

%^GREEN%^call me->AddChannel("ds_test")%^RESET%^
