                   Dead Souls Administration

    Being a successful MUD admin is heavily dependent
on how well you can get stuff done. It also depends on
your ability to manage people, resolve conflict, articulate
direction, enforce guidelines, and inspire loyalty.
    But those other things I can't help you with. What
I can help you with is having the tools you need to get
stuff done.

    Your most valuable tools will be the Dead Souls FAQs:

http://dead-souls.net/ds-admin-faq.html

http://dead-souls.net/ds-creator-faq.html

    Almost everything else will flow from your 
familiarity and understanding of the information there.

    Navigate to the /secure/cmds/admins directory. This
is where your commands are. Know them. Understand them.
In particular, pay close attention to the command:

admintool

    It is a valuable tool for new admins to get important
stuff done before they are 100% familiar with everything
they need.

    Finally, the intermud Dead Souls community is a
vital resource. They are (thus far) friendly and helpful,
and if the Player's Handbook, Creator's Manual, and
the (upcoming) Admin's Guide don't have the answer, use
the <ds> channel to ask for help.

    As to the qualities of leadership, determination,
humility, responsibility, fairness, and selflessness you'll
need to make a successful mud, you are on your own.

    Good luck.
