				<SAMPLE EMOTE CREATION>

Let's add the emote Snicker. Just simply, an emote that says "You snicker" when you type "snicker".
Since it will have no arguments, you don't need to add a parser rule or adverbs.

> addemote snicker
Enter error message: Snicker at whom?
Enter a parser rule for snicker: 
Enter the verbs: snicker
Enter message: $agent_name $agent_verb.
Enter adverbs: 
Emote 'snicker' added.

Now let's add a rule to 'snicker' to make it more useful. Let's add "snicker at [someone]", with a living person as a target.
Since there will still be no adverbs, we'll leave the adverbs blank, but we will be using the parser rule, because we want to snicker AT someone.

> addemote -add
Enter emote name: snicker
Enter error message: Snicker at whom?
Enter a parser rule for snicker: at LIV
Enter the verbs: snicker
Enter message: $agent_name $agent_verb at $target_name.
Enter adverbs: 
Emote 'snicker' added.

Now let's add the ability to use adverbs with our 'snicker' emotion, like 'snicker at shadyman loudly' and 'snicker loudly at shadyman'. Note we'll be adding two rules at once.
If you want your users to use their own (non-approved) adverbs or strings of text, you should put '*' in the adverbs section. Otherwise, put '-' to use only pre-approved adverbs.

> addemote -add
Enter emote name: snicker
Enter error message: Snicker at whom?
Enter a parser rule for snicker: at LIV STR,STR at LIV
Enter the verbs: snicker
Enter message: $agent_name $agent_verb at $target_name $adverb.
Enter adverbs: *
Emote 'snicker' added.

Go ahead and experiment with various types of parsing rules, using LIV, STR, LVS, and prepositions such as 'with', 'as', 'like', etc.
