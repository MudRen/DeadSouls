                      Dead Souls Grid System

    The Dead Souls grid is a dynamically generated coordinate system
that assigns x,y,z coordinates to each room, as possible. When a room
is loaded, it checks ROOMS_D for its own coordinates. If it lacks
coordinates, it checks for the coordinates of neighboring rooms and tries
to calculate its own coordinates and reports them to ROOMS_D.

    The idea of rooms with coordinates is to allow for game mechanics
that work across rooms, such as directional teleports, cross-room combat,
and the like. It is not necessary for every mud, and it can be disabled
in config.h if you don't want it.

    If you've created a new domain and it doesn't seem to be included
in the grid, ensure your domain has a room named room/start.c , and
set the coordinates for that room to be something that either makes
sense for the coordinates of the rest of the mud, or that are certain
not to conflict with existing coordinates by being very far away from 
everything else. In the start.c room's create() function, ensure
you have a directive that looks like this:

SetCoordinates("9000,7000,0");

    But, of course, with suitable x,y,z coordinates for your mud.

    Once you've done this, erase the existing grid cache and begin the
process of rebuilding it with mapper drones. The command to do this is:

gridconfig reset

    It will take some time for the grid to rebuild, depending on the size
of your mud. You should be able to see the progress of that rebuild in
the wizmap, if you have enabled that functionality.
