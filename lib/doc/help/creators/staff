                      Dead Souls Magical Wooden Staff

   The Dead Souls Quick Creation System is a big, complicated mess
for a number of reasons, mostly having to do with the necessity of
interpreting potentially unusual code.

   Among the compromises made to get the system working is that it is
bound to a specific object that must be carried. The original plan
had called for a daemon, but the modular design and need for global
variables meant either a mind-numbingly complex workaround, or individuating
the daemon functions. 

   Making the QCS work through a special object simplifies the 
interaction between modules, and limits the memory overhead to the
few characters that have a need to use it.

   Thus, in order to use QCS, you must be carrying the creator's staff,
which is /secure/obj/staff.c

   It doesn't have to be a staff. If you prefer it to be a hat, or a
gold watch, or whatever, feel free to make it so. Just remember that
the creation object must inherit the modules that the staff inherits, and
it must answer to the id "tanstaafl", and it must be somewhere in
/secure. See /secure/obj/glasses.c for an example.
