sefuns are functions available to all objects on the
mud. Any object may need to tell to a player, so a convenient
tell_player() sefun is made available as a global function to
all objects, in the form of a sefun, or "simulated efun", which
is in LPC rather than compiled code in the driver.
sefuns are kept in /secure/sefun.
