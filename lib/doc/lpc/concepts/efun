efuns are functions available to all objects on the
mud. Any object may need to know what time() it is, so rather
than have a time() function in every file that needs it, which
could be many, there is a time() function built into the
game that any object can use. An efun is built into the
driver, so there is no LPC code to look at. Because they
are compiled code, they tend to be very fast.
