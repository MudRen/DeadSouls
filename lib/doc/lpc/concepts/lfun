lfuns are functions specific to library objects. A shirt,
for example, has functions that a sword may not need, so
the LIB_ARMOR and LIB_WEAPON files contain their own functions,
not shared by other files (it's more complicated than this,
but that's the idea). These functions are library
functions, or lfuns. Typically they are found in the objects
defined by the files in /lib.
