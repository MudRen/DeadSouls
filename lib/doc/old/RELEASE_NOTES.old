---- 1.9r12 ---
- The roommaker is now obsolete, but is not being removed, as
  a convenience to those who've gotten used to it. Instead of
  the roommaker, use the create command, then the modify command
  to adjust the new room to your preferences.
- The thingmaker is now obsolete and has been removed. On-line
  object making and editing is done using the new commands: create,
  modify, delete. 
- admintool now edits groups. Use it in order to ensure you don't
  munge the groups.cfg formatting.
- Users in the TEST group are now allowed to log in when the mud is
  locked.
- ~/.profile will now be processed when creators log in, and commands
  included in it will be automatically executed.
- Added answering machine (for intercepting inconvenient tells).
- Fixed the sample virtual desert.
- Removed the prior intermud restrictions. Rather than requiring
  name changes to get onto i3, creators have to add intermud
  channels to themselves before talking on them. To do this:
  call me->AddChannel("intergossip")
  call me->AddChannel("intercre")
