---- Version 1.1pre released ----
7   added Dvarsks improved Virtual Libs.  Who knows we may provide 
    examples in the next revision.
6   added ftpd support within the mud.  This is courtesy of Dvarsk and
    Lima.  You must read and comply to the Lima USAGE document.  
    After you read that document you can start the ftpd using
    something like
    call /secure/daemon/inet->AddService("ftp", PORT_FTP,
    "/secure/lib/net/ftp.c", DATAGRAM)  if my feable memory is working.
5   added /lib/std/story.c  (read the lib to find out how to use it)

2   in /lib/living.c remove arguments to direct_smell_obj() line 128
       129

        if( (tmp = base_name(ob)) == LIB_PLAYER || tmp == LIB_CREATOR) {
            if( !PlayerName ) i = sizeof(stack = ({ob})+previous_object(-1));
            else if( file == DIR_PLAYERS+"/"+PlayerName[0..0]+"/"+
                     PlayerName + __SAVE_EXTENSION__ )
              return 1;
            else if( file == DIR_CRES+"/"+PlayerName[0..0]+"/"+
                     PlayerName + __SAVE_EXTENSION__ )
              return 1;
            else i = sizeof(stack = ({ ob }));
        }
        else if( tmp + __SAVE_EXTENSION__ == file ) return 1;
