set_bit - set a bit in a bitstring 
string set_bit( string str, int n ); 

Return the new string where bit 'n' is set in string 'str'. Note that the old string 'str' is not modified. 

The maximum value of 'n' is limited by the value of the 'maximum bits in a bitfield' entry in the driver config file. 

The new string will automatically be extended if needed. 

Bits are packed 6 per byte in printable strings.
