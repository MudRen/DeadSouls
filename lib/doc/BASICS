Handling Files: the Basics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) The "more" prompt:
   Text generally scrolls with the "more" system, which
reads a page, then prompts you to read further. In Frontiers,
the way to advance to the next page is to hit <return>.
This will take you to the next page of text. To
scroll backward, hit the "b" key, then <return>.
   To stop reading the file,
hit the "q" key, and return.

2) The file/directory structure:
   Information is stored in files. Files are organized in
directories. Directories are organized in other directories.
This text, for example, is in the file 
/doc/BASICS
   If you wanted to look at this file without the manual, you
could type: more /doc/BASICS
and you would get to read this file again.

3) Handling files and directories:
   The /domains directory contains a bunch of other directories
which contain more directories and files. This way of organizing
information helps keep similar or related information together.
   To look at the contents of the /domains directory, you type:
cd /domains
and then type:
ls
   The "ls" command lets you see a list of the contents of the
directory you've specified. To go to your home directory, issue
the "cd" command by itself, then "ls". You will then see the
contents of your own directory. The top level directory of the
mud is accessed through "cd /" without quotations. If you "ls"
then, you'll see the directories in which *everything* in the
mud is kept. You may explore from there.

4) Common file/directory commands:

ls     - Lists your current working directory
cd     - Changes directory to whatever you specify. If there is
         a directory called joe in your current working directory,
         "cd joe" without quotations will change your current
         working directory to joe, and "ls" will list the contents
         of that directory. 
cd ..  - Moves you up one directory.
more   - Displays the contents of a file. Doesn't work with
         directories. If schmoe is a file in your current working
         directory, then "more schmoe" will display the contents
         of that file. If it's a directory, you'll need to "ls".
ed     - Lets you edit the specified file, if it belongs to you.
         If in your home directory there is a file called 
         workroom.c, then "ed workroom.c" will allow you to edit
         that file and change it to what you want. Read Chapter
         2 of this manual section for details on the editor.
