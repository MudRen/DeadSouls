            Documentation and Support for Dead Souls 2


	As of this writing, the Dead Souls project has received
permission to include the old Nightmare docs we'd been missing.

	You can now browse through the build documentation in
the /doc directory. These docs are also conveniently packaged in 
a "manual" format. You can find the Creator's Manual in the
chest in your workroom, and it contains this documentation.

	For your convenience, a telnet room has been added to your
mud that can help you connect to Frontiers, so that you may ask
for help if you run into trouble. Just enter the telnet room
west and north of the wizard hall, and type: connect

	You may ask questions of creators there, but
don't be offended if they are more interested in building
their mud than helping you with yours.
