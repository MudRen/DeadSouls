		   Building Food and Drink Sellers

This document details the building of barkeeps, waiters, and other
such people who sell food and drink.  Barkeeps are NPC's, and
therefore everythign which applies to NPC's applies to barkeeps.  

To build a barkeep, you should inherit LIB_BARKEEP.

Beyond the functions specific to NPC's barkeeps also make use of the
following functions:

mapping SetMenuItems(mapping menu);
mapping AddMenuItem(string item, string file);
mapping RemoveMenuItem(string item);
mapping GetMenuItems();
string SetLocalCurrency(string curr);

When building a barkeep, you must add some mechanism in the room in
which the barkeep is placed for people to view a list of things for
sale.

*****
mapping SetMenuItems(mapping menu);
*****

Example: SetMenuItems( ([ "coffee" : "/realms/descartes/coffee" ]) );

Sets which menu items are found in which file.  This is a mapping with
the name of the item as a key and the file in which it is located as
the value.

*****
mapping AddMenuItem(string item, string file);
*****

Example: AddMenuItem("lobster", "/realms/descartes/lobster");

Adds one menu item at a time to the list of menu items.

*****
mapping RemoveMenuItem(string item);
*****

Example: RemoveMenuItem("coffee");

Removes the named item from the menu.

*****
mapping GetMenuItems();
*****

Returns all the menu items for this barkeep.  Useful in building your
menu list.

*****
string SetLocalCurrency(string curr);
*****

Example: SetLocalCurrency("khucha");

Sets the currency in which the barkeep does business.
