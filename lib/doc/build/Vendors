			Building Store Vendors
		     The Nightmare IV LPC Library
		 written by Descartes of Borg 950528

This document details the creation of vendor objects, NPC's which buy
and sell items.  Note that vendors are NPC's, so everything in the
document on building NPC's applies to vendors.  It is recommended that
you be completely familiar with that document before moving on to this
one.

Building vendors is actually quite simple, with very little required
beyond the NPC requirements.  In fact, only the following function
calls are unique to vendors:

string SetLocalCurrency(string currency);
string SetStorageRoom(string room);
int SetMaxItems(int num);
int SetVendorType(int vt);

One special note, however, is that the skill "bargaining" is extremely
important to vendors.  Namely, the higher the bargaining, the harder
it is for players to get decent prices.

*****
string SetLocalCurrency(string curr);
*****

Example: SetLocalCurrency("electrum");

Sets the currency which the vendor will use for doing business.  The
currencies should be approved by the approval team.

*****
string SetStorageRoom(string room);
*****

Example: SetStorageRoom("/domains/Praxis/horace_storage");

Identifies the file name of the room in which the vendor will be
storing items for sale.  This room should never be accessible to
players.

*****
int SetMaxItems(int num);
*****

Example: SetMaxItems(60);

Sets the maximum number of items a vendor can keep in storage at any
given time.  Refer to approval documentation for proper numbers for
this.

*****
int SetVendorType(int type);
*****

Examples: 
	SetVendorType(VT_WEAPON);
	SetVendorType(VT_ARMOUR | VT_WEAPON);

Sets which types of items a vendor will buy and sell.  A list of all
vendor types is in /include/vendor_types.h.  You may allow a vendor to
sell multiple types using the | operator.
