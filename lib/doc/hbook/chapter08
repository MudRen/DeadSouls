chapter 8 "Stats details"

Stats are very important! Depending on the style of
play you prefer, different stats can be of more value
to you. Fighters may prefer strength, mages 
may favor intelligence.

%^RED%^IMPORTANT TIP%^RESET%^: Players start off with 15 stat points
they can add to their stats...so that if you find your
strength is abysmally low, you can raise it to where
your character is playable at lower levels. Don't
forget to type: %^GREEN%^help customize%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^About "stat classes"%^RESET%^: Depending on the race you choose at
character creation, your stat class will be something
in the range of 1 to 5. This is a measure of the stat's
typical priority for that race. For example, orcs are very
strong, and so not only do they usually start with a
high strength stat, their strength class is 1, meaning 
that every time an orc has a level promotion, their strength
stat is also raised by 1. Humans, however, have a strength
stat class of 3, meaning a human player's strength stat
is increased by 1 only every third level promotion.

%^CYAN%^Deviation%^RESET%^:Starting in Dead Souls 2.9a18, a player can choose to
"deviate" from her race's default stat classes. For example,
you *can* have an orc mage with a high-priority intelligence
stat. To do so, you use the deviate command to set your
stat deviation...meaning you're going to devote a certain
percent of the XP you earn to making yourself better at
some stats you choose. Naturally, the more you want to
change a stat class, the more expensive this will be in
terms of your XP deviance cost. For more information,
see: %^GREEN%^help deviate%^RESET%^


%^CYAN%^Some notes on individual stats%^RESET%^: 

High %^MAGENTA%^strength%^RESET%^ means you hit hard when you're in combat, 
but it also means you might be strong enough to perform some 
tasks others cannot, like open very heavy metal doors.


High %^MAGENTA%^intelligence%^RESET%^ means you're able to learn things
better, quicker, like skill training and languages. It
means your training points do you more good.


High %^MAGENTA%^charisma%^RESET%^ means it's easier to befriend animals, 
which is important if you want to, for example, mount
a horse:

%^GREEN%^befriend horse%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^mount horse%^RESET%^


%^MAGENTA%^Agility%^RESET%^ and %^MAGENTA%^coordination%^RESET%^ are important for avoiding being
hit, and for certain special abilities like stealth,
lock picking, shooting, etc.


%^MAGENTA%^Wisdom%^RESET%^ is important for some types of spells.


%^MAGENTA%^Durability%^RESET%^ helps determine how much stamina you have...
this is vital to lasting through long combat or moving
quickly through terrain on foot.


Finally, %^MAGENTA%^luck%^RESET%^ is an all-around general good thing to have
lots of...some random situations may call for it, and just
like in real life, it's hard to know when it'll come in handy,
but boy can it mean the difference between win and fail!
