chapter 1 "Introduction"

    If you are unfamiliar with LPC based muds in general or Dead Souls
mudlib in particular, you will find this handbook valuable in 
orienting you around what you can do and how you can do it.

    Keep in mind that this handbook describes the features of a mud
running an unmodifed version of the lib. The mud you are on may
differ somewhat, though probably not extremely so.

    To advance a page in a chapter, just hit "return".

   Let's start with just navigating this book. Once you are done
reading this chapter, you can read the next chapter by typing:

%^GREEN%^read chapter 2 in handbook%^RESET%^

    Make sure you wait until you are done reading this chapter,
though. The reason you should wait is that you are now in "reading
mode", which means that anything you type and send to the mud
is actually a command to the editing system that is displaying this
text.

    To leave reading mode (or more accurately, pager, or ed mode)
you can hit "return" a bunch of times to complete the chapter, thus
automatically exiting the pager. Another way is to enter the
letter "q" (without the quotes) and then "return". That will also
make you stop reading.

    When you are not in reading mode, you can find out the chapter
titles by typing:

%^GREEN%^read index in handbook%^RESET%^

   You really should read the whole thing, but in case you don't, the
chapter titles will help as a reference to find the information you
need. 

    Something to watch out for is that if you or your environment 
contain another handbook, the mud may not know which one you are
trying to read. If you get a message like "Which of the two handbooks
would you like to read?", you can try one or more of the following:

%^GREEN%^read index in first handbook%^RESET%^

%^GREEN%^read index in my handbook%^RESET%^

%^GREEN%^read index in my first player handbook%^RESET%^
