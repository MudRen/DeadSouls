chapter 6 "Note to New Creators"

    You should probably hang on to this book for reference. If
you lose it, pick up a copy at the adventurers hall.

    However, you need to start reading the Creators Manual. If
you don't have one on you, get the one in the chest in your workroom.

    If you're new to coding, start with chapter 31. It'll
get you started with the Quick Creation System, or QCS.
