chapter 5 "Communication"

    There are many ways to communicate with other players. If
you're in the same room as your intended listener, you can just 
use the "say" command, like this:

%^GREEN%^say hi, crat%^RESET%^

    If the message is secret, you can "whisper":

%^GREEN%^whisper to cratylus are you idle?%^RESET%^

    If you want to say something that everyone in the mud can
hear, use the "shout" command (at the cost of a lot of stamina):

%^GREEN%^shout hey crat, wheredya go?%^RESET%^

    Or, if it's an important secret and the target is not in the 
same room as you, you can use the magical "tell" command:

%^GREEN%^tell cratylus are you mad at me or something?%^RESET%^


    There are also special communication lines on the mud that are
class or role-specific. For example, if you type:

%^GREEN%^newbie does anyone know what's up with cratylus?%^RESET%^

    All people who are tuned into the newbie line will get
your message. To see what lines are available to you, type:

%^GREEN%^lines%^RESET%^

To see who is listening to the newbie channel:

%^GREEN%^list newbie%^RESET%^

To see who is listening to some other channel on some other mud:

%^GREEN%^list otherchannel@othermud%^RESET%^


    To enable or disable a line, just type the name of it with no message.

    To see a brief history of the past few messages on a line (in
this case, the newbie line), type:

%^GREEN%^hist newbie%^RESET%^


    Spamming lines is rude and probably dangerous to your character, so 
be sure you comply with your mud's rules on lines. 


    Your mud may be on the intermud network. To find out, type the
command:

%^GREEN%^mudlist%^RESET%^

    If a list of muds comes up, you know your mud is probably
on the intermud3 communication network. Dead Souls by default restricts
players from access to intermud channels, but you can "tell" to
players on other muds, if you want. If you think your friend Xyzzy
is online on a mud on intermud3, you can issue this command:

%^GREEN%^locate xyzzy%^RESET%^

    If he's logged into a mud on i3, you will get something like:

Xyzzy was just located on Frontiers. (idle 00:03:17) [status: inactive]

    You can then tell to him:

%^GREEN%^tell xyzzy@frontiers dude, what's the deal with crat lately?%^RESET%^


    Sometimes a player or NPC does not understand your character's
native tongue. For example, if you are en elf, your native tongue is
not English, it is Edhellen. If someone talks to you in English, you
might see something like this:

Xyzzy says in English, "leka mifahmam, potong-hwa."

    Since your character doesn't speak English, what you see is gibberish.
If you find a language teacher, your proficiency in the language they
teach you will allow you to understand more of the words you hear.

    Suppose that your elf character is now 100% fluent in English.
If you greet a human player named Xyzzy by typing:

%^GREEN%^say hello there, xyzzy%^RESET%^

    Xyzzy will probably see something like:

Noobie says in Edhellen, "pericolo temak, forshtor."

    Instead, if you want to speak to a human, you'll have to type:

%^GREEN%^speak in english hello there, xyzzy%^RESET%^


    To find out what languages you speak, type:

%^GREEN%^language%^RESET%^
