EVENTDESTRUCT

NAME
        eventDestruct()

SYNOPSIS
        int eventDestruct()

DESCRIPTION
        This lfun provides a convenient means to ensure proper things happen when an object is destructed. Rather than simply destruct(), you can use eventDestruct to, for example, move a thing to the furnace before it is actually removed from memory. Any invocation of eventDestruct() in a child object should probably make a scope reference to eventDestruct in its inheritance chain.

EXAMPLES
        int eventDestruct(){ write("Gbye!"); return ::eventDestruct(); }
