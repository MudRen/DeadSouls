EVENTDIE

NAME
        eventDie()



SYNOPSIS
        varargs int eventDie(mixed agent)



DESCRIPTION
        When a creature dies, this function is called in them. The argument should be what it is that killed them. Note that this is a function that is heavily overridden, and must be handled with care if modified. If you don't know what a function override is, then don't mess with this function. If eventDie() returns something other than a positive integer, the creature doesn't die in the conventional sense: they instead become undead.
