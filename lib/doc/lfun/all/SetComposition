SETCOMPOSITION

NAME
        SetComposition()

SYNOPSIS
        varargs string SetComposition(string comp, string name, string *nouns, string *adjs, string short, string desc)

DESCRIPTION
        LIB_CLAY is an object that provides a flexible means for creating "chunks" of things, such as a chunk of clay when a clay golem has an arm amputated. A new chunk, inheriting LIB_CLAY, uses SetComposition to establish what kind of thing it is.

EXAMPLES
        ob = new(LIB_CLAY); ob->SetComposition(this_object()->GetBodyComposition(), "hunk", ({"chunk","hunk","piece"}), ({"plastic"}), "a plastic chunk","This is a piece of plastic.")

LOCATION
        /lib/clay
