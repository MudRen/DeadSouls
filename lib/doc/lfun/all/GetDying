GETDYING

NAME
        GetDying

SYNOPSIS
        int GetDying()

DESCRIPTION
        Sometimes things happen a bit too fast, and the lib tries to do something fatal to a body that's already dying. This check prevents logical paradoxes from occurring.

EXAMPLES
         

LOCATION
        /lib/body
