HANDLETELLER

NAME
        HandleTeller()

SYNOPSIS
        int HandleTeller(string str)

DESCRIPTION
        The LIB_BANK inheritable is a kind of 'wrapper' for the LIB_TELLER npc. Rather than have to type 'ask zoe to withdraw 100 dollars', that add_actions in LIB_BANK catch the 'withdraw' command and send it and the arguments provided to the teller, so a player can just type 'withdraw 100 dollars'. The HandleTeller() function provides that call to the npc.
