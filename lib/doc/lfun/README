This directory contains lfun, or library function, documentation.
The complete bunch is in the all/ subdirectory. In the lib/
subdirectory you will find functions broken down by the files
in which they are found.

Note that some function labels, such as static, nomask, and the
like, may be inconsistent betwee what is listed here and what
you find in the file.
