chapter 40 "Useful Creator Commands"

Moving around:
-------------

* To go to your workroom:
%^GREEN%^home%^RESET%^

* To go to someone else's workroom, "home <person>", for example:
%^GREEN%^home cratylus%^RESET%^

* To go to the town pub:
%^GREEN%^goto /domains/town/room/tavern%^RESET%^

* Or:
%^GREEN%^cd /domains/town/room%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^goto tavern%^RESET%^

* To return to where you were before you went somewhere else:
%^GREEN%^return%^RESET%^

* To bring someone to you, "trans <person>". For example:
%^GREEN%^trans cratylus%^RESET%^

* To send them back when you're done with them:
%^GREEN%^return cratylus%^RESET%^


Dealing with living beings:
---------------------------

* To force everyone in a room to stop fighting:
%^GREEN%^quell%^RESET%^

* To let them resume combat:
%^GREEN%^unquell%^RESET%^

* To insta-kill a living being, "zap <thing>". For example:
%^GREEN%^zap orc%^RESET%^

* To bring to life a player who somehow left the death
room without regenerating, "resurrect <person>", For example:
%^GREEN%^resurrect cratylus%^RESET%^

* To make a living being do something you want, "force <thing>
<command>". For example:
%^GREEN%^force thief drop towel%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^force thief go west%^RESET%^

* For complex management of a living being's vital statistics,
skills, health, score, and satiety levels, use the medical
tricorder in the chest in your workroom.

* For a detailed report of a living being's physical status:
%^GREEN%^stat orc%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^stat cratylus%^RESET%^


Handling objects in general:
---------------------------

* To destroy an object, "dest <thing>". Note that the object's
inventory will probably move to the room it was occupying.
For example, if you:

%^GREEN%^dest fighter%^RESET%^

  You may find that the room now contains a sword, shield, and
chainmail shirt, but no fighter.

* To reset an object to its original state, "reload <thing>". Note
that this also makes the object incorporate any changes you
made to its file. For example:
%^GREEN%^reload fighter%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^reload here%^RESET%^

* To load a file into memory, "update file". This is used when you
have edited an object's file, and want the mud to use the new
stuff you created. For example, if you edited the fighter's file
and wanted to know if it will load properly into memory, you'd
type:
%^GREEN%^update /realms/you/area/npc/fighter.c%^RESET%^

Or:
%^GREEN%^cd /realms/you/area/npc/%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^update fighter%^RESET%^

  If you do not specify an object to update, the mud assumes you
want to update the room you are in. If there is a problem with the
room's code, and it does not load, you will be dropped into the
"void". 
  If the room's code is ok and it updates, anything in the room 
that isn't part of its permanent inventory (except for players) will
disappear from the room.

* To make a copy of an object appear, "clone <file>". For example:
%^GREEN%^clone /realms/you/area/npc/fighter%^RESET%^

Or:
%^GREEN%^cd /realms/you/area/npc/%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^clone fighter%^RESET%^

* To know the precise contents of an object, use scan:
%^GREEN%^scan fighter%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^scan here%^RESET%^

  If you want to know not only what the fighter has, but 
also what any containers he is carrying have, use the "-d" flag:
%^GREEN%^scan -d fighter%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^scan -d here%^RESET%^

Debugging commands:
--------------------

* elog: This will report back to you the last few lines of
your error log. Usually this is very helpful in nailing down
which lines of a file contain errors. If you are admin, you
may be working on files other than your home dir. If those
files fail to update, you can supply elog with a directory name
to specify where to look for an error report:
%^GREEN%^elog secure%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^elog cmds%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^elog lib%^RESET%^

* dbxwhere: provides a list of the chain of messages caught
in your last runtime error.

* dbxframe <number>: Using the list number from dbxwhere, 
dbxframe can pinpoint exactly where in that link the error
came from.

%^GREEN%^tail /log/runtime%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^tail /log/catch%^RESET%^
%^GREEN%^tail /log/player_errors%^RESET%^


miscellaneous useful commands:
-----------------------------

* %^GREEN%^people%^RESET%^: reports who is logged on, what site they logged
in from, and what room they are in.

* %^GREEN%^mudtime%^RESET%^: reports the time of day in the mud (nothing to
do with the time of day anywhere in the real world).

* %^GREEN%^bk <thing or file>%^RESET%^: makes a unique copy of that thing
or file and puts it in /realms/you/bak

*%^GREEN%^ restore <filename>%^RESET%^: copies the last backup of the
filename from your bak/ directory into where it used
to be.
