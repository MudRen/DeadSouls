chapter 24 "Quests"
			   Building Quests
		  from the Nightmare IV LPC Library
		 written by Descartes of Borg 950716

Unlike previous Nightmare versions, Nightmare IV has no support for
centralized quest administration.  This was done under the belief that
coercive questing was among the least favourite features players have
mentioned about the MUDs I have encountered.  Nevertheless, the
presence of quests is still an extrememly important part of any MUD.
Since the coercive nature (needing to complete quest X to raise to
level Y) has been removed, other ways to make questing worthwhile need
to be found.

The first, and most obvious, is to properly reward the player with
money, items, and skill and stat points.  The other bit of support is
for a title list.  Each quest, or accomplishment, is added to a list
of accomplishments the player has.  The player may display any of
those at any time as part of their title.

The interface to this is simple:

player_object->AddQuest(string title, string description);

Example:

this_player()->AddQuest("the slayer of frogs", 
	"You viciously slayed the evil frogs of Wernmeister that "
	"threatened the peaceful town with warts and unabated fly murder.");

In the player's biography, they will see the description along with
the date they accomplished the task.  From their title list, they will
now be able to choose this title.
