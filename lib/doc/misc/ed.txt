The ed editor


  There's two modes in the editor: the input
mode and the command mode. While in the input
mode, what you type is added to the file
you're editing. While in command mode, you
can view or make modifications to the file.

  To edit a new file called joe.c you would
type "ed joe.c", which puts you right into
input mode. You'd then write whatever code
you want. When finished, on a blank line you
would enter a single period, then hit enter.
This exits from input mode and puts you in
command mode.

  When in command mode, you can modify the
file (like deleting lines, for example), 
exit without saving your code, or exit and
save the code. To delete line 1, you'd hit
"1d" while in command mode.
  To add a line after line 5, you'd hit
"5a", which would put you in input mode
right after line 5. To replace line 5 you'd
"5c" while in command mode.

  For a full list of commands available in
command mode, hit "h" and enter while in the
editor command mode.

  To exit the editor and save the file
as modified, issue the "x" command at
the editor. To exit without saving, 
use "Q".

  For your new object to be loaded into memory,
you must update it after you've edited it.
"update joe.c" will load the changes into memory.

Creator Bulletin Board if you're confused!
