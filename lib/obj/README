The /obj directory contains files required by lib
systems. Removing this directory or its contents,
or modifying its contents may generate unexpected
behavior from your mud.

For example, do not attempt to "fix" area_room.c or
stargate.c. Trying to load those files in /obj will
generate errors because it is *supposed* to do that.

Do not try to use these objects directly, and do not
copy them into your area directories as templates. 
QCS uses these rooms in very special ways, and having them
in your area directories may confuse it and give you
errors you don't understand.
