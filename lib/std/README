This directory (grudgingly) exists for backward-compatibility
with backward libs. It is intended to contain files which 
don't have much code at all. Rather, they are placeholders for
the files that really *should* be inherited.

If there *are* code-heavy files here, they are usually lifted
directly from some older lib, and should not be considered a
canonical way of doing things.
