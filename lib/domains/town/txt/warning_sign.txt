WARNING!

North of here is Larstown, an area where some creatures
*may* be hostile. Be cautious, and make sure you read the
Player's Handbook.

South is the Virtual Campus, an area with conference rooms
and a "University" feel to promote a learning environment.

These areas are *not* a mud. They are sample objects, 
rooms, and NPC's (aka mobs) that are intended to be used
in learning and teaching how to create a real mud of
your own, using the Dead Souls 2 mudlib.

If you have logged into a mud and you are reading this,
do not assume "All DS muds are the same." Assume that for
whatever reason, this mud has not yet replaced the default
sample areas with areas of their own.
