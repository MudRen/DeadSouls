	WELCOME TO THE ADVENTURERS' GUILD!

   Things are pretty straightforward here. You can advance
to higher levels by possessing enough experience and having
completed enough quests. 

   Type "status" to see how many xp's you have. Those are
experience points, and with enough of them, you can advance
to the next level. 

   At level 9, you must have enough quest points, as
well. Read the scroll here to see what quests are available.
You only get points the first time you complete a quest.

The advancement requirements break down like this:

Level   Title                        XP                   QP
