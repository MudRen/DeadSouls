WARNING!

This area is Praxis. It is part of the old,
obsolete precursor to Dead Souls called Nightmare 3.

It has been somewhat unbroken, but is largely non-functional.

The rooms and items here can be expected to function
unexpectedly. This domain is here not as an example of
how to build for Dead Souls, but as a historical artifact
to give you context about the origins of Dead Souls.

Whatever bugs you find in Praxis, therefore, are not
going to be fixed. Consider it a museum piece, a mud
area like a prehistoric insect caught in amber: perfect
in its imperfection, sublime in its permanence.
