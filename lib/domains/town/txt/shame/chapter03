[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Yeah, how fucked.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: one for each tower - I 'm trying to work out if its
April 1st somewhere...
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I vote we turn the fucking middle east into a
large sheet of glass.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: its a terrorist thing!
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I'm glad I don't live in england, where there are
a lot of terrorists.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: it makes life fun!
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: nightly bulletins saying some irish bloke has shot
another.
[igossip] AndrewH@Anarres II: keeps the irish population down. like the potato
famine.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II nods
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: its most definetly terrorist.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: two planes, two towers.. thats not just unlucky.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: well, back to work...
[igossip] Zeddicus@Haven: A father came in the bedroom to find his 13-year-old
daughter smoking a cigarette. "My God! How long have you been smoking?" screams
the father.  "Since I lost my virginity," replies the girl.  "You lost your
VIRGINITY!!! When the hell did this happen?" shrieks the father.  "I don't
remember," says the girl. "I was completely drunk."
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: holy fuck.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: yeah no doubt.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy chants: "Nuke The Middle East!  Nuke The Middle
East!  Nuke The Middle East!"
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: why do you say its the middle east? you said that
about oklahoma and it was some US bloke.
[igossip] Styxx@OuterSpace: shaddup.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: you HM, are a racist homophobe.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: You are obviously a jew-sympathiser.  You will
burn with your dirty hebrew friends.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: hmmm. HM, shut the fuck up.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: whoever it is must die.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Al, do you worship Osama Bin Laden?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Why can't people pick new and exciting targets
for their terrorist acts?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: 'Lets blow up the world trade center!' 'Lets
crash into the world trade center!'
[igossip] Al@Anarres II grins at HM, "I only worship you"
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Al, you must blow up the quik-mart.  The infidels
must pay.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: wouldn't it be a better statement to fly the plane
into the white house ?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Harder to do.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: or are the protests against the WTO stepped up from
hippies throwing rocks in the streets ?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: *blinks*
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: maybe they were passenger planes and someone at air
traffic f*cked up?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: BREAKING NEWS: One of the planes was being flows
by Captain Hazelwood, of the Exxon Valdez!
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: harder than hijacking two 747s and flying them into
the center of NY ?
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: doesn;t Xyzzy have summin' to do with flying things?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Yes, Nirvan. Why are you so... curious?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: so the SDN is working over the white house then ?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Try making a hijacked plane hit a ground target.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: good point Sini.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: ahh - so you've thought ab out this then ?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: it is a good point.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: No, I just work for the FBI. But you, on the
other hand.. *shuffles papers* Nirvan, AKA "Idi Ib Amin".. why are YOU so
curious?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: woo - breaking news.  CNN have decided that it isn't
an accident !
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: so anyone got a good news site with live feed, that
isn't down(DoS'd)?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: turn on a TV ?
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: haha not an accident - thats clever
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: I'm at work, and there is no tv here
[igossip] Pickett@Sumu:

pg.
[announce] Xyzzy enters Frontiers.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: MSN Search : We can't find "cnn.com".
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: oh god - someone's bombed CNN!
[cre] Cratylus: oi.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: slashdot is even running the story - because CNN is
DOS'ed :)
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: is CCN DoS'd or just very busy?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Try CNN instead of CCN.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Maybe you'll get somewhere.
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: very busy is a DoS - so is MSNBC and ABCnews
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: DoS implied bad intent.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: rather than just lots of happy punters.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: haha.. dailynews.yahoo.com changed their
story to simply "A plane crashed into one of the twin towers of the World Trade
Center Tuesday, witnesses said."   and that's it.. it loads just fine now :)
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: they're hit by the slashdot effect, except on a
bigger scale
[igossip] Xyzzy: wtf.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Jesus, that's impressive.
[igossip] Cratylus: thats so fucked up.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Undh@Sumu: impressive.. yeah .)
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: If I were a terrorist, I would have waited until
more people were at work.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: 9am isn't a bad time...
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: morning meetings happening. people mainly in at 8am.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: people start work at 8 in most of those companies.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: all gathered together in rooms.
[cre] Xyzzy: thats fucked up,  dude.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: a good day not to be too highly promoted I would
guess.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: hmm, 2nd plane "was passenger 727"... oops.
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: yeah, FBI was investigating a report of a hijacking
at the time
[cre] Cratylus: bizarre.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: bush wants to 'hunt down the people who did this'
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: nice - hijack a plane full of US citizen and then
crash it into the trade center :) sweet.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: get me my gun, maw...
[igossip] Cratylus: well it's easier than carting a bomb in there, with their
current security.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: look in 'the charred remains between floor 98
and 99'
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: seems there is a 3rd plane that's been hijacked ?
[igossip] Cratylus: i guess they'll need to install antiaricraft turrets now.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: YES!
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: hell yeah.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Whoever invents the force field will make a
billion.
[igossip] Xyzzy: but, we already HAVE.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: if someone wants to be a terrorist, they'll be a
terrorist.
[igossip] Xyzzy: the antimissile shield will protect us!
[igossip] Cratylus: and if they want to sing out, sing out.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Styxx@OuterSpace: asia.cnn.com still works.
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: a 3rd plane?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: the pentagon is on fire.
[igossip] Steve@Anarres II: pentagon on fire?
[igossip] Cratylus: cats and dogs, living together.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: and the palestinians are claiming responsibility.
[igossip] Xyzzy: dont cross the streams.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: and my boss wanted me to go to israel last week.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Ooh, ht//praiseallah.terrorists.com has the

[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Wtf, is today Allah's birthday or something?
[igossip] Cratylus: can someone post a burning-pentagon url?
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: white house has been evacuated.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: pentagon is on fire, and been evacuated.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: if you were going to start a nuclear war, which two
buildings would you want to have evacuated first?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: today is the 20th anniversary of the UN
international day of peace.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: I guess they still have NORAD or some such place.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: but war games was on the TV at the weekend.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: No shit, Nirvan?
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: I know how to get in ther!

Through the gaping hole.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: the pentagon has like, 12 stories going down and a
power plant and such. Its paper pushers up top.

/wiz/cratylus # [cre] Cratylus: traffic will really suck later.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: slashdot is down now too :)
[igossip] Diruces@Mystic: they say they have exvacuated the west wing of the
whitehouse too.
[cre] Cratylus: and they'll drop a plane on the highway.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: I saw a comment on slashdot wondering if there was a
'cyberattack' going on at the same time - what a dumb fuckwith.
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: most people on slashdot are fuckwits
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: where is washington amll ?

[igossip] Diruces@Mystic: i like the idea of cheney as pres.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: apparently the pentagon fire was caused by a plane
or rocket attack.
[cre] Xyzzy: "if this was a coordinated attack, what ELSE might be happening
rigt now?"
[cre] Xyzzy: then tehre weas the pentagon.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: bush is at some school somewhere.

[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: or the standard 'newswire'
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: CONFIRMED: It was a plane that crashed into the
Pentagon, too.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: CNN is law.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: If CNN makes up stuff about aliens, I believe
it.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: who was saying it was really difficult to hit ground
targets with planes ? :)
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: did they miss ?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: "Aliens crashed into the Pentagon" I'll believe
it.
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: heh, lots of the US govt agencies get their info
from CNN since its cheaper than having their own people in the field
[igossip] Blaze@VargonMUD: All american flights have been grounded.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: it was - illegal Aliens crashed into the Pentagon.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Heh =-)
[igossip] Xyzzy: ALIENS BOMBED THE PENTAGON?!?!
[igossip] Cratylus: those two targets seem kinda pointless to.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Cratylus: me.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: which ones ?
[igossip] Xyzzy: "she thought they said 'ILLEGAL aliens' and signed up"
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: symbolic Crat.
[igossip] Cratylus: they shoulda found bush's locaation and dropped a plane on
him.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: very symbolic. especially outside of US.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Maybe it was Jenna Bush flying daddy's plane.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: he was in a school.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: hijacking any plane and crashing it is gonna get you
coverage.

They kept the "inside joke" in the movie.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: unmanned US spy plane.

[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: the IRA, Iraq want a piece...
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: the NBA.
[igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: problem is, everyone will try to claim it.
[igossip] Xyzzy: not to jinx us, but it seems that you never know when the shit

[igossip] Cratylus: the judean people's front.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: SPLITTERS!
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: it's the anti-globalisation protesters.

[igossip] Cratylus: can't believe it didnt occur to them to drop a plane on
clinton's harlem office.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: who cares about clinton ?
[igossip] Cratylus: best way to intimidat current presidents is killing former

/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Nirvan@Nanvaent: saw the 'third explosion' replay - looked like the

/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Presto@Discworld: no.
[igossip] Xyzzy: fuck, i need a list, here.
[igossip] Pickett@Sumu: ... President Bush, ..  from a school in Sarasota,
Fla...
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: Well, Jesus, it wasn't a Cessna, it was a frigging
737/767 depending on who you believe.
[igossip] Cratylus: i say we cut off aid to israel until they handle their
terrorist problem.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Pickett@Sumu: total three planes crashed in wtc. the last one caused
the tower to collapse.
[igossip] Xyzzy: overheard at work: whitehouse has smoke comng out of it.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: it's not exactly "their" problem any more.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: BREAKING NEWS: Dave Matthew's song "Crash into

[igossip] Cratylus: well its all coming from there, one way or another.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: THREE?
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: It didn't look to me like there was a third crash
into the WTC, looked like it just fell.
[igossip] Cratylus: it aint the IRA dropping planes in NYC.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Pickett@Sumu: yeah, a third (smaller) plane in the bottom part of the
tower caused it to fall.
[igossip] Xyzzy: maybe they stored a plane in the basement.
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: CNN now says the Sears Tower has NOT been
evacuated.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: if I were working there, I'd have evacuated.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Thank you, Presto. *Presses a button labeled

[cre] Cratylus: thats pathetic.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Myrias@Discworld: The major news websites are all crashing under the
weight of traffic.
[cre] Cratylus: i cant believe cnn got overwhelmed.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: no, they've been hit by more planes!
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: so, any bets on the FBI or CIA going out next?
[cre] Cratylus: dispensing breaking news is their JOB.
/wiz/cratylus # [cre] Cratylus: i wnt them FIRED.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: youd think cnn would be their FIRST target.
[cre] Xyzzy: yer on cre.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: anyone started any rumours about massive virtual
terrorism attack on the US websites?
[cre] Cratylus: i know.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Musashi@Sumu: no way, they want people to know.
[cre] Xyzzy: ah.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: i'm sure there's mileage in that one.
[igossip] Xyzzy: anyone familiar with the laws concerning gun possession and
transport in the state of maryland?
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: right now X, no one will care.
[igossip] Xyzzy: GOOD POINT!
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: explosion on Capitol hill.
[igossip] Xyzzy: where.
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: or not.
[cre] Cratylus: cant believe i have to turn on the radio for news now.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: no, that's what happened.
[igossip] Xyzzy: is todays date of any signifigance?
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: apparently CNN is reporting a Capitol Hill hit
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: I wish people would get their fucking story
straight. :-b.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: 20th anniversary of world peace, Xy.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: CNN is reporting everything's ok on Capitol
Hill, except a loud sound.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: oh.
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: CNNfn is talking to someone on Pennsylvania Ave,
and they said there's no explosion.
[igossip] Izzy@VargonMUD: It's the Democrats complaining.
[igossip] Cratylus: npr's interviewing freaked out WTC occupants.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: now THATS journalistic integrity.
[igossip] Cratylus: it's quite tedious.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: can you imagine the traffic and general panic?
[igossip] Cratylus: huh. the upper part of one of them did in fact collapse.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: a few players here have confirmed capitol hill as
being hit
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: Interesting that of all the scary talk over recent
years about how easy it would be for terrorists to deploy biological, chemical,
nuclear or other fancy weapons in NYC, that when it actually happens, it could
have been done the same way 20 years ago.
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: Empire State building now evacuated. Duh.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Yes, thanks, 30 minute ago man.
[igossip] Xyzzy: plane bombings is SO last decade.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: I wonder how they'll persuade King Kong to come down.

[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Famous last words, target!
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: nah, it was 'fore!'
[igossip] Tarl@Alsherok: In case no one said it, it appears one of the planes
was american airlines flight number 11, I hope no one knew anyone supposed to
be on that..
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: so one tower has fallen over completly?
[igossip] Cratylus: no. the upper part of one collapsed.

[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: carbomb at state dept confirmed?

[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: seems so, 1 may have been shot down near Pittsburgh.

[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: remember sinistrad, much as you hate the
'imperialists', someone hates your beliefs just as much.. you deserve to die

[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Honey, it's funny that people are always
laughing at the misfortunes of others on this channel - now those same people
are all, "dude, be more sensitive"
[igossip] Teny@Mystic: D.C Streets are one big traffic Jam.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: pretty much not a joking matter.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: misfortunte != death.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: -t.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II nods at Spoo
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Go be righteous somewhere else. When it's not

[igossip] Al@Anarres II: hey Sini, this doesnt affect me, but it does affect
alot of ppl.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: shrugs, I'm not American, but I'm still not gonna laugh
at people dying.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: there are like 50,000 ppl working in the WTO.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: I ain't laughing because this is only the start of the

[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Not any more!
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: more like 75K.
[igossip] Skullslayer@RoD: plus all the people in the surrounding buildings
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: people were jumping out of the building for over
1/2 hour.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: [flap] Iain: itn reporting 100 tousand dead in new

[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: in case you hadn't noticed the madmen have just fucked

[igossip] Leto@Earth: 100.000 ?
[igossip] Iain@Anarres II: 100k people.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: well fuck you for being so consciencious, yeah I care,

[igossip] Iain@Anarres II: lots of them firefighters/police.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: "Whine whine, now it's hurting us directly,
please don't laugh.. please forget that I used to laugh at you when you were

[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: I live on Long Island, firefighters and police
were called into the city.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: all bridges and tunnels to NYC are closed.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: swim!
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: how are they getting ppl out ?
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: they are not.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: With straws.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: both the towers are basically piles of burning rubble,
unlikely to be any survivors in that.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: I heard a witness say he worked on the 36th floor and
they got out ok.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: they had 1/2 an hour before the collapse.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: 1st or 2nd tower?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: http://www.shef.ac.uk/cs1xtc/sa/planewtc.jpg.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: 69 ppl on the plane that flew into the wtc.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: both towers are gone.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: no doubt.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: first tower, they started leaving right after they saw
the 2nd plane.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: 2nd plane hit 18 mins after first.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Vote Yes to Proposition 37 "Systematic Ethnic
Clensing of America"
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: "Leave only the injuns"
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: what, you mean America will belong to the natives
again?
[igossip] Shandor@Bakhara: just the mexicans.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Leave only the whites, the blacks, and the
mexicans.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: cuz everybody else is out to fucking get us.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: boston is very close, right across the LI sound.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: 2 planes, carrying approx 80 passengers each..
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: unsure which they were.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: seems they just shot down the 2nd plane as well.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: the one near Dulles.

[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Reality always looks so fake, doesn't it?
[igossip] Izzy@VargonMUD: "This just in, JFK shot."
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: NBC just reported bomb gone off in NYC Highschool.
[igossip] Xyzzy: WE GOT A MAN ON TH MOON?!
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: yeah, it was obviously a big fucking coincidence.
[igossip] Xyzzy: fox investigative news.
[igossip] Xyzzy: at work.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: FAA say several planes still unaccounted for.
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: This just in: Jimmy Hoffa still missing. Police are

[igossip] Xyzzy: plane crash 80 miles SE of pittsburg.
[igossip] Xyzzy: holy shit, footage of the WTC collapsing.
[igossip] Presto@Discworld: American Air confirms two flights down, United at

[igossip] Al@Anarres II: well done Xyzzy, do catch up.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: which was the dullus one?
[igossip] Xyzzy: gee, its almost as if i havent had a TV at work for th last
two hours.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: the only thing slightly amusing is that I
swore to myself that I'd never set foot in the WTC again.. then seconds later,
one collapses..then the other.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: you've had i3 though. and it's all been mentioned on

[igossip] Xyzzy: its all YOUR fault, vash.
[igossip] Xyzzy: no, im SEEING the collapse for th first time.

[igossip] Al@Anarres II giggles
[igossip] Xyzzy: expansion pack.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: equally, how do u define a terrorist attack. this
might not be a terrorist attack.
[igossip] Hekubah@Annwn: Might be an act of war?
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: could end up being defined as an opening move in a
war.
[cre] Zaphod: few.
[cre] Zaphod: phewww.
[igossip] Xyzzy: oh yeah, fergot, it might just be a wacky coincidence.
[cre] Zaphod: my package made it out of newark.

[igossip] Xyzzy: yer MOM is at defcon5
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Hey, more people died right now than in Pearl
Harbor.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: but, the style of attack will prolly mean it's a
terrorist attack that started a war in history books.
[igossip] Xyzzy: what, you got a death-count goin, sini?
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: s'diff than pearl harbour or czechoslovakia.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: shut up dick.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: please someone ban Xyzzy.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: WW 1 was started because of a terrorist attack that
killed 1 person.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent nods.
[igossip] Xyzzy: please someone suck my dick.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Xy, 50K+ people worked in the towers.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: How many people died at Pearl Harbor?
[igossip] Cratylus watches in amusement as Vashkar greedily gobbles Xyzzy's
knob.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: Vrax@SI says there was 10k in each tower,
approximately, at the time.
[igossip] Xyzzy: what, like i work for th navy or something, sini?
[cre] Zaphod: my packge drove right through ny just before this.
[cre] Cratylus: yer motherboard?
/wiz/cratylus # [cre] Xyzzy: a little... coincidental.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: less than 2k people were killed at PH.
[igossip] Vraxor@Split Infinity: that's what the guy who owned the tower said.
[cre] Zaphod: this one is my video card.
[cre] Zaphod: mb just left la.
[cre] Zaphod: maybe it's been hijacked.
[igossip] Xyzzy: that tower was 0WN3D.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: You have to account for tourists in the towers too.
[igossip] Vraxor@Split Infinity: and the people in the planes.
[cre] Zaphod: now I REALLY don't feel like going to the office.
[32m[igossip] Xyzzy: shoot, none of this is gonna drive up memory prices, will it?
[cre] Zaphod: buy it quick.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: automatic if the pres is in AF1
[cre] Zaphod: WTC attack sale!

/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: saying it was cause of US supporting israel.
[igossip] Xyzzy: yknow, i think what we really need now is a verbal fight on i3
[igossip] Shandor@Bakhara: your mom tastes like chicken and your dad smells of
a russian tea room.
[igossip] Xyzzy: HEY, now.
[igossip] Xyzzy: lets keep it civil.
[igossip] Cratylus: eldeberries, you fool.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: ``Personally we received information that he
planned very, very big attacks against American interests. We received several
warnings like this. We did not take it so seriously, preferring to see what
would happen before reporting it.''
[igossip] Cratylus: smelt of em.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Shandor@Bakhara: windows sucks!  RH linux is the top of them all.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: "He told us he was gonna do it, but we wanted to
see what he was gonna do before we told anybody."
[cre] Zaphod: cute.
[igossip] Xyzzy: we called his bluff, alright.
[igossip] Shandor@Bakhara: who says that, sini?
[cre] Zaphod: he told me to stay home.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I hear the arabs in San Fran are celebrating the
attacks.  Somebody go kill them all.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: NOW YOU KNOW.
[cre] Cratylus: ya.
/wiz/cratylus # [cre] Zaphod: you heard him.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: That link Vash gave out.
[cre] Cratylus: stamford is prolly a panicky madhouse.
/wiz/cratylus # [cre] Zaphod: no doubt.
[igossip] Xyzzy: and knowing's half th battle!
[cre] Zaphod: and I've got CABLE.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: hell, the Arabs are going to give someone some target
practice if they don't fuck off.
[igossip] Shandor@Bakhara: half of our IT department is made of arabs.  I
wouldn't want to be them right now.  Although, this is a mall city.
[igossip] Xyzzy: mall city? like, with shops n stuff?
[igossip] Cratylus: made of crabs? what?
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: it ain't really the Arabs anyway, just a completely
mad bunch of lunatics who want to take us back the the dark ages.
[igossip] Cratylus: the republicans?
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: like i said, i think its in the rulebook that theyre not
allowed to be so organized and effective.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: That movie with Denzel Washington and Bruce
Willis starts out with a lot of terrorist attacks. That is NOTHING compared to
this.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity nods.
[igossip] Cratylus: i bet the french are all like "serves em right, bourgeois
pigs"
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: makes Tom Clancy look tame too.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: cnn back up.
[igossip] Cratylus: i think they got lucky. you couldnt *really* expect those
fucking buildings to drop from plane hits.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: they were rather large ones.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: Bush calls trade center crashes terrorist act.
[igossip] Cratylus: large buildings.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: you think?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Thanks, Danny.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: in today's day n' age, it's not hard to be a
competent terrorist.  It's like Osama bin Laden went to a tech institute or
something.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: large aircraft.
[igossip] Cratylus: fat asses.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Steve@Anarres II: um.. they knew where to hit them to have best
chance of toppling them..
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: cnn.com is breaking under the strain again.
[igossip] Xyzzy: this just in: i hafta pee.
[igossip] Cratylus: ok, master terrorist.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Zaphod: ooo ooo Tom Clancy's on cnn!
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: He's the authority, I bet!
[igossip] Cratylus: that does it. im playing half life. screw this.
/wiz/cratylus # [igossip] Xyzzy: hes written books n stuff!
[igossip] Xyzzy: just like smack!
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: prolly complaining that the bastards stole his idea.
[igossip] Steve@Anarres II: part-way up near the top.. you prolly won't get
them immediately, but fire will weaken the structure and the top will fall
cruching the rest of the building..
[igossip] Xyzzy: cool, Dexter's Laboratory on cartoon network.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: yeah, the steel skeleton would weaken, concrete and
facade wouldn't hold the weight.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: it appears there was a secondary explosion in the
first tower to go down too.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: I think the WTC buildings had their skeleton on the
outside; but don't hold me to that.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: So it wasn't just the planes?
[igossip] Xyzzy: yeah! lets speculate on the various ways these people died
today!
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: Spoo, they're thinking it was the plane's
fuel tank exploding.
[igossip] Steve@Anarres II: they showed ppl diving outa windows on the news..
that's sick..
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: was quite a way down from the impact site.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: could well have been though.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II nods at Spoo
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: I think we just have to wait and see.
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: yeah, I was questioning the logistics of that
guess also.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: if the top, above the crash site, fell down, even just
1meter, the energy would be enough to crumble the steel below.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: thats what happened with the second tower.
[cre] Zaphod: shit.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: it might have crumbled many stories down, making it
look like an explosion below the crash site.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: roof went, took the rest with it.
[cre] Zaphod: I bet the coffee I ordered don't get sent out.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: yeah, common :(
[cre] Xyzzy: always thinkin of yerself.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II shuts up about civil engineering and goes back to
hacking sendmail
[cre] Zaphod: well, I need my coffee.
[igossip] Boltthrower@Styx: apparently the roof-collapse scheme works better
than the basement-bomb thing did :(
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: nah, there was a clear fireball shortly before the
first collapse (and I saw that live so no, it wasn't a plane)
[igossip] Xyzzy: how about the "fly a few hundred tons of metal into the
building" scheme?
[igossip] Isis@Inon-Net: Yeah, I saw it too just before I left for work.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: 737 and a 767, couple of hundred tonnes each.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy sets an arab on fire.
[igossip] Zaphod: camp david get hit?
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: close to camp david.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: cool, HM, gulf-news.com is hosted nr you ;)
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: lots of momentum to damage the buildings, the second
aircraft blew right through the tower too.
[igossip] Xyzzy: can you imagine how dark it could be in manhattan right now?
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: that one was shot down.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: what, at midday?
[igossip] Xyzzy: yes.
[igossip] Xyzzy: with all the smoke.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: not very then.
[igossip] Xyzzy: well, i guess you CAN imagine it, then.
[igossip] Zaphod: 8 hijacked planes still in the air?
[igossip] Xyzzy: but for how long....
[igossip] Xyzzy: HOW LONG!?!
[igossip] Vashkar@Split Infinity: where'd you hear 8, Zaphod?
[igossip] Xyzzy: hes just makin shit up, now.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: Its not that dark.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I heard 8 total planes.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: and we've already found some of them.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: 5 floors in pentagon have collapased.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: Not unless you where wtc was.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: we found 2 in the trade center, one in the
pentagon... \
[igossip] Xyzzy: HM AM FUNNYMAN!
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: Brits have lost contact with 2 aircraft as well.
[igossip] CyberTiger@Anarres II: s/found/happened to notice/
[igossip] Xyzzy: wtf, some dude disassembling a pistol on CourtTV, sayin how
easy it could be to blah blah blah.
[igossip] BarWench@Inon-Net: ;nods.
[igossip] Al@Anarres II: have we Spoo? where you hear that?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: So is Bin laden a palestinian or a jew?
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: what aircraft?
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: my father is on a flight from london to new york.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: It says 'Islamic Fundamentalist', which is like a
palestinian, right?
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: bin laden is saudi.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: He'll be landing in canada. :(
[igossip] Pam@Split Infinity: They're evacuating some of the taller buildings
in London, according to MSNBC.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: he is a rich, eccentric saudi.
[igossip] Xyzzy: look out, hellmonger is gunnin for SOMEone.
[igossip] Tea@Nanvaent: canada is all closed too i thought?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I'm down to kill me some arabs now.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: And some happy palestinians.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: we must declare war against Afghanistan.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Need to be set on fire.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: why afghanistan?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Why not?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Valid point.  KILL EM ALL!
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: afghanistan has been housing bin laden for years.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: they refuse to turn him over.
[igossip] Megaboz@Lima Bean: I just have this feeling that bush is going to do
something stupid.
[igossip] Ebony@Earth: Third plane ahs crashed in pentagon.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I'm all about letting them know whats up.  Take
the afghan royal family or whatnot.  And cook them on a spit.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: do something stupid like what?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Like what?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Like starting to kill people?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: The american people want revenge.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: if he nuked them, I would be only mildly distubed.
[igossip] Megaboz@Lima Bean: nuked was the thing I was going for.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: which bastard stopped development of the neutron bomb,
perfect time to test it.
[igossip] Xyzzy chants: "NUKE!  NUKE!  NUKE!"
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I would'nt really be phased.  I'd like to see the
middle east as a field of glass.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: so how many planes have crashed so far? 5? 6?
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: Ebony, that 3rd plane in the pentagon confirmed?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: 5.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Three on target, two off target.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I think bombing them would be cool.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: hard to tell really, web sites are all choked.
[igossip] Xyzzy: jeez, how many damn kids did the Waltons have?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: 7.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: all worth around 17-18 bil.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: my understanding is 2 into thw world trade center, 2
into the pentagon, and one outside pittsburgh.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: right.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Only 1 into the pentagon.
[igossip] Isis@Inon-Net: And one in Sommerset PA as well.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: reading in a few places of a 3rd into the pentagon
though.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: 1 outside pitts, 1 recently confirmed outside
Sommerset.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Thats outside pitts.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: sommerset == pitssburgh.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: oh, yeah,and the air force shot one down outside
camp david.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: a third plane intot he pentagon?
[igossip] Futility@UOSSMUD: The one in Somerset is the one near pittsburgh.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Really?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: "United Airlines Flight 93 airliner headed from
Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, crashed near Somerset, Pennsylvania --
police said initial reports indicated no survivors. It was not known if this
was connected to the attacks. United also said it was "deeply concerned" about
Flight l75 from Boston to Los Angeles."
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: On CNN, they just confirmed that 175 went down,
too.
[igossip] Xyzzy: deepl.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: so 3 shot down and 3/4 crashed.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: We shot down three planes?
[igossip] Xyzzy: yeah, HM, score one for th good guys.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: there were 7 hijacked.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: from advfn: A third plane crashes near the Pentagon in
Washington DC.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: where did 175 go down?
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: well maybe not shotdown, hard to sort out the news
from the confused.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three hijacked planes crashed
into major U.S. landmarks on Tuesday, destroying both of New York's mighty twin
towers, hitting the Pentagon in Washington and plunging the United States into
unprecedented chaos and panic.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: fucking kill them all.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: now that Reuters has confirmed it, I'll stop worrying
that it was all US propaganda being parroted by CNN.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: no doubt.
[igossip] Xyzzy: the adjective "mighty" brought to you at no extra charge.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I only know of three terrorist crashes, and one
United crash.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: And whats up on 175?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Two united crashes.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: where did it crash?
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: the united crash is certainly a terorist thing.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: probably the pilot taking it down to prevent
somethign evil.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I thought terrorists all capped off the pilots to
prevent them from fucking up the program?
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: One of the planes that crashed into the World Trade
Center was American Airlines' Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles, said Lori
Bassani, spokesperson for American's flight attendants union. ;
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: someone said "fuck the terrorists"
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Yeah, I don't think any pilot would go, "Ok,
I'll crash this plane into the twin towers or he'll shoot me."
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: www.reuters.com.
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: No doubt.  YOu are going to die anyway.  Fuck it.
I'd put that shit in the dirt.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: I agree... but I bet on the one outside pittsburgh
was stoipped by someone.
[igossip] Xyzzy: hellmonger, you seem to be fairly well-versed in "hijacker
protocol"
[igossip] Xyzzy: something you wannatell us?
[igossip] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Common sense.
[igossip] Boltthrower@Styx: you online from a plane?
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Microsoft announced the release of a new version
of Microsoft Flight.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: I just fear that bioterrorism is part of this.
[igossip] Smack@Lima Bean: that we have not even seen the worst yet.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Microsoft announced the release of a new version
of Microsoft Flight Simulator today. The terrain has been updated in New York
so that two piles of rubble sit where the twin World Trade Center towers used
to stand. When asked how they had this updated version burned before the towers
were actually bombed Bill Gates responded "We like to be prepared for any
contingiency. This is a horrible tragedy and we grieve for the loss that people
are facing. We will donate .001% of all profits of this product to help the
families of those killed during this horrible event." Newly appointed Vice
President of Microsoft, Osama bin Laden added: "We'd also like to point out
that we have the only flight simulator on the market that has true to the day
updated terrain. If you want to own the most realistic up to date simulator,
you've got to buy ours."
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: sorry, even I find that funny :)
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: =)
[igossip] Xyzzy: and we all know how lousy a sense of humor spoo has.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: at least I have one Xy :)
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: looks like the pentagon fire is under control.
[igossip] Xyzzy: WHEW!
[igossip] Xyzzy: what about these rumors of car bombings and capitol hill/
state building/whitehouse, etc.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Exhaust pipes going off.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: well, heard several reports of car bomb outside state
building.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: there was no bomb at the State Department.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: and one of a bomb in a nyc school.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: english.pravda.ru.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: prolly someone hearing a backfire.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: US DOLLAR ABRUPTLY FALLEN DOWN.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: According to current bidding, US dollar has fallen
abruptly relative to the Euro and to Yena. American stock markets has not
started to work yet. Planes are in air to hamper the second plane.
[igossip] Xyzzy: ALL YOUR NEWS ARE BELONG TO US.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: According to NPR John Hopkins, the USA have not need
to be considerate with the terrorists.
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: laf.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: Manhattan island encircled by policemen.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: Suicide pilots piloting two planes have practically
rammed two buildings of International Trade Centre at a height of 85th storey.
These two buildings are known to the whole world thanks to film 'King Kong'.
That are the buildings over which the big monkey was mounting. More detail...
[igossip] Xyzzy: holding hands.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: POPULATION FROM CENTRE OF CHICAGO EVACUATED. LONDON
PANIC STRICKEN;
[igossip] Xyzzy: hu uhuh uhu, you said "mounting"
[igossip] Musashi@Sumu: london is hardly panic stricken :P.
[igossip] Xyzzy: wait, LONDON panic stricken?
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: king kong climbed the empire state building.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: they mean the remake.
[igossip] Blue@Inon-Net: NEWSFLASH: King Kong to be remade again, new buildings
sought.
[igossip] Xyzzy: as opposed to the porn film, "King Dong", where he climbed
lightfoot's mother.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: fuck you dick.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: I think "have practically rammed 2 buildings" is an
understatement.
[igossip] Xyzzy: ACH! fook me dick!
[igossip] Xyzzy: well, it wasnt very IMpractical.
[igossip] Lightfoot@VargonMUD: I would love to kick the living shit out of a
little punk like you.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: "ADVENTURES OF AMERICAN RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT R-3.
NOW IN RUSSIAN AIRSPACE;"
[igossip] Zaphod: whoa.
[igossip] Sinistrad@VargonMUD: Danny, I've seen you. You're the smallest
goddamn punk ever.
[igossip] Zaphod: qvc has suspended broadcasts.
[igossip] Zaphod: jesus.
[igossip] Spoo@Nanvaent: surely that should be "Now in Russian Cinemas"
[igossip] Xyzzy: and he doesnt mean overall height.
[igossip] Bayard@Nanvaent: no more qvc?
