WARNING!

This area is Ylsrim. It is part of the old,
broken version of Dead Souls. It has been mostly unbroken,
so that for example the desert and bank roof work properly.

However, you will note obvious differences in design
between Ylsrim and the main sample town. Remember, neither
Ylsrim nor the town are intended to *be* a mud.
They are only examples of places and things that you can
examine to guide you in building your own mud.

Whatever bugs you find in Ylsrim, therefore, are not
going to be fixed. Consider it a museum piece, a mud
area like a prehistoric insect caught in amber: perfect
in its imperfection, sublime in its permanence.

To return to the main sample area, use the stargate by typing:
