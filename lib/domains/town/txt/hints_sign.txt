HELPFUL HINTS

- This is a special sample area of places, objects and creatures.
It is not a mud. It is a set of examples that can be used in making
a mud. If you are reading this, it's because you are in a mud that
is under construction.

- Read the players handbook. It is really very helpful. You read
it like this:

read chapter 1 in handbook
read index in handbook
read chapter 2 in handbook

- If you want to know what is inside a container (like a bag or
a box) you have to look *in* it. Example: look in bag

- If you don't have the "two-handed" or "two-weapon" combat
skills, you will fight very poorly when wielding multiple or
two-handed weapons. Generally only fighters train in these skills.
Wield just one weapon, unless you're a fighter.

- The wimpy command will make you automatically run away from 
combat when your health hits the percentage you specify.

- Armor is very important. Without it, it is very easy to lose life 
and limb.

- If you can't carry all your money, deposit some in the bank.

- "wear all" is a quick way to equip, but don't forget to 
"wield", too.

- If you're hurt, go to Clepius for healing. He can also cure 
diseases, restore severed limbs, and extract foreign objects.

- Make sure to read any signs or lists you see. They contain 
important instructions.

- Advancing in levels improves your statistics and enhances 
your abilities. See Dirk in the Adventurer's Hall for details.

- Once you choose a class, such as fighter or mage, it is
 hard to switch again, and expensive.

- Anyone can learn spells, but it's easier for mages and they 
get more bang for the buck. However, mages are pretty weak, 
physically.

- Fighters are big and tough, but being dumb and clumsy 
has drawbacks.

- Getting drunk and sleeping enhances healing rate, but 
once you are asleep you have to wait to wake up. It can be 
anywhere between two and ten minutes.

- Avoiding hunger and thirst enhances healing.

- Bags and packs to put things in make it easier to carry a lot 
of stuff around.

- Without a weapon, humanoids are quite vulnerable in combat.

- If your foot or leg is severed, you cannot stand or walk. 
To go anywhere while lying down, you must "crawl". For 
example, "crawl south".

- If you are lying down or sitting, you cannot fight.

- Your skills improve with use. For example, spellcasting, 
combat, defense, and stealing, all get better the more 
you do it.

- If you are badly overmatched in a fight, try 
finding magical items to enhance your abilities. 
Or heck, ask a friend to connect and help you fight.

- Room lighting can be deceptive. You might be able to see 
enough to make out what a room looks like, but not enough to 
see all the exits or all the stuff in a room. If in doubt, 
use a light source, like a torch or flashlight.

- Even if you can see the room well, some items may be hidden. 
"search" is a useful command for finding hidden items.

- Sometimes having many similar objects can be confusing. Or 
you might have armor that can be worn on different limbs. 
You may have to be specific. Examples:
	- sell first boot to otik
	- buy large flashlight from otik
	- put small knife in leather pack
	- wield short sword in right hand
	- wear badge on torso
	- shoot second orc with water pistol
	- read inscription on ring (instead of read ring)
	- push second button
	- eat my first ham sandwich
	- articulate grand unification theory (doesn't work quite yet)

- South of the church is a newbie mansion, with lots 
of treasure and stuff for newbies. There's even a quest 
or two to solve. Just don't expect to get past the guard 
after reaching non-newbie status.

- This mud is under construction, so you may get stuck or 
find a bad bug. Don't get mad. Just report the bug or ask for help.
