        The Standard Domain for the Nightmare 3 Object Library

This is the ANCIENT Praxis domain from the old Nightmare 3
mudlib. It had been updated to work on Dead Souls 2, and 
the objects all will load into memory properly, and for
the most part, they work the way they're supposed to.

However, this is *NOT* an example of what you should do
when coding areas. This domain is provided for both historical
context and for examples of how things *can* be done.

Fancy stuff probably doesn't work, since it may depend on
subsystems used in NM3 that are not used in DS2 (such as
UID security). 

Broken things here will very likely *NOT* be fixed. Like
Ylsrim, this area is a museum piece, provided for reference
and education, but for display purposes only.
