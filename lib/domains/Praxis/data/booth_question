 
   One possible way to cut down on the amount of lag that we have been 
experiencing recently is to limit the number of players on the mud at any given
time.  Therefore the administrators would like player input on limiting the
number of players permitted to log on at any given time to 35.  The results
of this poll will have an influence on the decision that is reached, so 
please consider your vote carefully.
 
A. I think that Nightmare should only be permitted to have 35 players on at
   any given time.  (Note:  this would only be a temporary solution until
   another can be found)
 
B. I think that Nightmare should not limit the number of players, and
   alternative methods of fighting the lag should be found.
 

Also note with solution A, archwizards and above would still be able to get
on at any time.
To vote type either <vote a> or <vote b>.  As always second characters are not
allowed to vote.  Immortals may feel free to vote in this poll, if they desire.
