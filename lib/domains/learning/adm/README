	       The Administrative Directory 

This directory contains files necessary for domain administration.

Specifically it is the default directory for the access object,
which is used for providing nonstandard access to files with
the "grant" command.

This is also the location where domain-specific daemons can be
expected to reside.

In the case of archaic domains, such as Ylsrim, this is where 
some mandatory rooms are expected to be, such as freezer.c and void.c
