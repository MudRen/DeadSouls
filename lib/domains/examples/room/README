Example Rooms Index
===========================================================================
exroom1: Changing Chats when a quest has been done.
exroom2: example of a room you can inherit.  All its functions
         go to the rooms which inherit it.  They can over-write those functions.
         All three rooms which inherit it manipulate 'pull' in their own
         rooms.  They don't affect 'pull' or "myvar" in this room.
exroom2a: inherits exroom2 and ADDS to the object_entered function
exroom2b: inherits exroom2 and adds nothing to object_entered (but you'll 
          see that it uses the object_entered from exroom2).
exroom2c: inherits exroom2 and removes the object_entered from exroom2.
exroom3:  move_player
exroom4:  pre/post exits add/remove exits  set/query/remove tempvars
exroom5:  look_fail & tempvars pt 2.
exroom6:  pre-exit (sneak)
exroom7:  two verbs for one add_action
