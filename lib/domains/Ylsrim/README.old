	The Standard Domain for the Nightmare V Object Library

This domain is designed to provide examples of all Nightmare V Object
Library inheritables.  It also serves as the standard distribution
domain and should serve as an adequate area for people wanting to open
up a mud quickly with minimum hassle.  We do recommend, if you have
the resources, that you use this stuff only for examples and write
your own, unique standard domain.  To do so, you will need in your new
standard domain all of the files in /domains/Ylsrim/adm and you will
also need a start room (which here is /domains/Ylsrim/room/bazaar).
Then go into /secure/include/dirs.h and change DIR_STANDARD_DOMAIN to
point to your new domain directory, and /secure/include/rooms.h to
point to your new start room.
