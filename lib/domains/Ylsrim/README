	The Standard Domain for the Nightmare V Object Library

This is the original sample domain provided with Dead Souls 1.1pre.

It has been modified to work correctly with Dead Souls 2, but you will
notice some differences in layout and design philosophy. Please regard this
domain as a source of examples, but note that it is here for historical
and back-compatibility purposes, and not necessarily as a model for
building standards.
